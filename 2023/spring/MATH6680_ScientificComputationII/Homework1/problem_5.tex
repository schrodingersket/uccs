\textbf{Trefethen 2.7}

Modify \texttt{Program 3} to determine the maximum error over $\mathbb{R}$ in the sinc function interpolants of the
square wave and the hat function, and to produce a log-log plot of these two error maxima as functions of $h$. 
(Good choices for $h$ are $2^{-3}$, $2^{-4}$, $2^{-5}$,$2^{-6}$.) What convergence rates do you observe as $h \to 0$?

\begin{solution}
  The log-log plots for sinc interpolants of the square wave and hat functions (respectively) are given in the plot 
  below:

  \begin{figure}[h]

    \caption{log-log plot of sinc interpolant errors}
  \end{figure}

  From the above, we see that the square wave error is approximately constant, and so converges at the rate
  $\mathcal{O}(h^0)$. Similarly, we see that the convergence rate for the hat function is approximately 
  $\mathcal{O}(h^1)$ which we attribute to the respective differentiability (or lack thereof) of these functions.
