$u = e^{\sin^2{(x)}},\; u' = 2 \sin{(x)} \cos{(x)} e^{\sin^2{(x)}}$

\begin{solution}
  At around $10^{-13}$, we find that the error flattens out and machine rounding errors dominate. Until then, our convergence is fourth order:

  We observe $\mathcal{O}(h^4)$ convergence with finite differences and exponential spectral convergence since $u(x)$ is
  analytic as a composition of analytic functions.
