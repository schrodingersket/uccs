$ u' = 2 \sin{(x)} \cos{(x)} e^{\sin^2{(x)}}$

\begin{solution}
  At around $10^{-13}$, we find that the error flattens out and machine rounding errors dominate. Until then, our convergence is fourth order:

  As before, we see that the computation time is approximately linear with respect to the number of equidistant partitions.
