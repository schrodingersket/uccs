\textbf{Trefethen 13.3}

Modify Program 19 (p. 82) to solve $u_{tt} = u_{xx}$ as before but with initial and boundary conditions

$$
u(x, 0) = 0, \quad u_x(-1, t) = 0, \quad u(1, t) = \sin{(10t)}
$$

Product an attractive plot of the solution for $0 \le t \le 5$.

\begin{solution}
    The solution plot for $0 \le t \le 5$ is given in Figure \ref{fig:problem_3}.

    We observe a constant solution at the left boundary $x = -1$ which represents our Neumann BC; at the
    right boundary $x = 1$, we observe a sinusoidal function of time with period $10$. Our initial condition 
    (at $t = 0$) is identically zero.
