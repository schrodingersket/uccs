\textbf{Trefethen 12.2}

Write a \texttt{MATLAB} program to implement (6.8) and (6.9) and construct the differentiation matrix $D_N$ associated
with an arbitrary set of distinct points $x_0, \ldots, x_N$. Combine it with \texttt{gauss} to create a function that
computes the matrix $D_N$ associated with Legendre points in $(-1, 1)$. Print results for $N = 1, 2, 3, 4$.
