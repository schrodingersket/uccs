Modify \texttt{Program 12} to make use of \texttt{chebfft} instead of \texttt{cheb}. The results should be the same as
\texttt{Output 12}, except for rounding errors. Are the effects of rounding errors smaller or larger than before?

    \label{fig:rounding_with_cheb}
  \end{figure}

  From Figures \ref{fig:rounding_with_cheb} and \ref{fig:rounding_with_chebfft}, we see that the rounding error is quite
  similar, as expected. The effects of rounding errors for \texttt{chebfft} are marginally smaller than those for 
  \texttt{cheb}.
