In fact, the truncated Taylor series falls short of optimal by a factor of about $2^N$, for it is known that as 
$N \to \infty$, $E_N \sim \frac{1}{2^N (N+1)!}$. Modify \texttt{Program 9} to produce a plot showing this asymptotic 
formula, the upper bound of (a), the error when $p(x)$ is obtained from interpolation in Chebyshev points, and the same
for equispaced points, all as a function of $N$ for $N = 1, 2, \ldots, 12$. Comment on the results.

  By Figure \ref{fig:interpolation_error_plots}, we see that Chebyshev interpolation minimizes the error, as expected and in 
  fact closely follows the known optimal minimax error. Equispaced interpolation, on the other hand, performs rather 
  worse than Chebyshev interpolation and is bounded by the truncated Taylor series error (which is itself a polynomial 
  interpolation).
