In fact, the truncated Taylor series falls short of optimal by a factor of about $2^N$, for it is known that as 
$N \to \infty$, $E_N \sim \frac{1}{2^N (N+1)!}$. Modify \texttt{Program 9} to produce a plot showing this asymptotic 
formula, the upper bound of (a), the error when $p(x)$ is obtained from interpolation in Chebyshev points, and the same
for equispaced points, all as a function of $N$ for $N = 1, 2, \ldots, 12$. Comment on the results.
