\textbf{Trefethen 6.8}

Let $D_N$ be the usual Chebyshev differentiation matrix. Show that the power $(D_N)^{N+1}$ is identically equal to zero.
Now try it on the computer for $N = 5$ and $N = 20$ and report the computed 2-norms $\Vert (D_5)^{6} \Vert_2$ and 
$\Vert (D_{20})^{21} \Vert_2$. Discuss.
