\textbf{Trefethen 8.6}

Write a code \texttt{chebfft2} for second-order differentiation by the FFT, and show by examples that it matches the
results obtained by matrices, apart from rounding errors.

\begin{solution}
  We demonstrate the efficacy of second-order differentation by the FFT by way of plotting the difference between values
  of $(D_N)^2 u$ and second-order FFT differentation of $u$ for a variety of functions $u$:
