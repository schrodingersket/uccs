Show that the only traveling "front" wave $u(x, t) = \phi (x - ct)$ with $\phi(-\infty) = 1$ and $\phi(+\infty) = 0$ 
which satisfies the PDE is

$$
u(x, t) = \left[ 1 + e^{ \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} x - \frac{5}{6} t } \right]^{-2}
$$

by deriving the ODE that $\phi$ must satisfy. Solve the resulting ODE numerically and, if possible, analytically.
