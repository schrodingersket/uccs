Since $u(x, t) \to 0$ as $x \to +\infty$ and $u(x, t) \to 1$ as $x \to -\infty$, we can approximate the traveling wave
given in (i) on $[-L, L]$, where $L$ is large enough that the wave front does not reach the boundary $x = L$ by imposing
the boundary conditions

$$
u(-L, t) = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad u(L, t) = 0
$$

with initial value $u(x, 0)$. Design and implement a Chebyshev collocation method to approximate the solution to the
PDE and study the convergence of the approximate solution as $L \to \infty$.
