Describe and implement a fourth-order Runge-Kutta and Fourier method for Burger's equation 

$$
u_t = \epsilon u_{xx} + u u_x
$$

with periodic boundary conditions on the interval $\Omega = [-\pi, \pi]$ from $T = [0, 1]$ and initial condition

$$
u(x, 0) = e^{-10 \sin^2{\left( \frac{x}{2} \right)}}
$$

with $\epsilon = 0.03$.

\begin{solution}
  Since we impose periodic boundary conditions on our spatial domain, we perform Fourier spectral differentiation in 
  space.
