The rapidly-evolving field of machine learning offers an exciting evolution of classical theories for 
modeling the complex physical systems that govern rainfall, flash flood dynamics, and other real-world fluid flows. 
Machine learning generally requires a large amount of training data from which to learn a useful model. However, 
when we combine experimental observations (such as water levels in a riverbed over time) with broad assumptions
about conservation of physical quantities, machine learning approaches become much more powerful in that they gain 
the capacity to infer information about unknown physical quantities. In this paper, we formulate a mathematical
model for physics-informed neural networks and use the resulting methodology to infer unknown subsurface topography 
in the shallow water scheme.
