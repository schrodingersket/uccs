We outline two approaches for solving this system of equations. In the first approach, we create a neural network which 
serves as an approximation to the true solution to the system. By minimizing the PDE residual, we train the neural 
network to satisfy the SWE system. The second approach we use is a classical Fourier pseudospectral method; because 
stabilithy and convergence properties for these methods are well-understood, we use pseudospectral solutions for two 
purposes. The first is as a reference solution with which to compare results obtained in the PINN scheme, and
the second is as a mechanism by which to generate training data with which to infer bathymetry via a PINN.
