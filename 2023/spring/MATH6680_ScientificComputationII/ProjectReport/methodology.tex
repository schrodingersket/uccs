We outline two approaches for solving this system of equations. In the titular scheme, we create a neural network that 
serves as an approximation to the true solution of the system. By minimizing the PDE residual, we train the neural 
network to satisfy the SWE system and call the resulting neural network a \textit{physics-informed neural network} 
(PINN). The auxiliary approach we use is a classical Fourier pseudospectral method; because 
stability and convergence properties for these methods are well understood, pseudospectral solutions serve two important
purposes in this project. Firstly, the pseudospectral solution serves as a reference with which to compare results
obtained in the PINN scheme. The second role of our pseudospectral solutions is to simulate experimental observations 
for wave height and velocity from which to infer bathymetry via a PINN.
