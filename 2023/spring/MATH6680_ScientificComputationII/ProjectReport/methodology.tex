We outline two approaches for solving this system of equations. In the titular scheme, we create a neural network which 
serves as an approximation to the true solution of the system. By minimizing the PDE residual, we train the neural 
network to satisfy the SWE system and call the resulting neural network a \textit{physics-informed neural network} 
(PINN). The auxiliary approach we use is a classical Fourier pseudospectral method; because 
stability and convergence properties for these methods are well understood, pseudospectral solutions are dual-purpose.
Firstly, the pseudospectral solution serves as a reference with which to compare results obtained in the PINN scheme. 
The second and equally important purpose for pseudospectral solutions is to simulate experimental observations for 
wave height and velocity from which to infer bathymetry via a PINN.
