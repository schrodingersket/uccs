In this chapter we will introduce spectral methods, for which the convergence rate is only limited by the regularity of the solution of the problem (and is exponential for analytical solutions).

  abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

  title     = {On the limited memory {BFGS} method for large scale optimization},
  author    = {Liu, Dong C and Nocedal, Jorge},
  abstract  = {We study the numerical performance of a limited memory
               quasi-Newton method for large scale optimization, which we call
               the L-BFGS method. We compare its performance with that of the
               method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines
               cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our
               numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than
               the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use
               additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the
               L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple
               scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned
               quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results
               show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton
               method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find
               that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive
               due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence
               properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on
               uniformly convex problems.},
