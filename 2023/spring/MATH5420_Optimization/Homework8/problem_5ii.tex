Show that the second-order sufficiency conditions do not hold anywhere, but that any point $x_*$ which satisfies the
first-order necessary conditions is a global minimizer.

\textit{Hint: } Show that there are no feasible directions of descent at $x_*$, and that this implies that $x_*$ is a
global minimizer.
