Find all stationary points of the problem

\begin{maxi*}
    {}{f(x) = x^T Q x}{}{}
    \addConstraint{x^T x}{= 1.}
\end{maxi*}

\begin{solution}
    Since we have only a single equality constraint, our vector of Lagrange multipliers reduces to a scalar value 
    $\lambda$. The Lagrangian for this problem is thus given by

    $$
    \mathcal{L}(x, \lambda) = f(x) - \lambda g(x) = x^T Q x - \lambda (x^T x - 1).
    $$

    Since $Q$ is symmetric, our first-order necessary condition for optimality occurs whenever

    $$
    \nabla_x \mathcal{L} = \nabla f - \lambda \nabla g = 2 Q x - 2 \lambda x = 2(Q - \lambda I) x = 0
    $$

    which is precisely the eigenvalue problem. Hence our stationary points $x$ are simply the eigenvectors of $Q$ 
    associated with the eigenvalues of $Q$.
