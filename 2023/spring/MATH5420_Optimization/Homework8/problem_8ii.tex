Determine which of the stationary points are global maximizers.

\begin{solution}
    Since stationary points are the eigenvectors of $Q$, our objective function is

    \begin{align*}
        f(x) &= x^T Q x \\
             &= x^T \lambda x \\
             &= \lambda x^T x \\
             &= \lambda
    \end{align*}

    and hence $f(x)$ is maximized for any eigenvector corresponding to the greatest eigenvalue of $Q$.
