Write the first- and second-order necessary optimality conditions. State all assumptions.

\begin{solution}
    Since $Q$ is symmetric, the gradient and Hessian of $f$ are given by 

    $$
    \nabla f(x) = Qx + c, \quad \nabla^2 f(x) + Q,
    $$

    respectively. The first-order necessary optimality condition therefore requires that there exists a vector 
    $\lambda_*$ of Lagrange multipliers such that

    $$
    A^T \lambda_* = \nabla f(x_*) = Qx_* + c
    $$

    where $\lambda_* \ge 0$ and $\lambda_*^T (A x_* - b) = 0$. The second-order necessary optimality condition requires
    that $Z^T \nabla^2 f(x_*) Z = Z^T Q Z$ be positive semidefinite where $Z$ is a null-space matrix for the matrix of 
    active constraints at $x_*$.
