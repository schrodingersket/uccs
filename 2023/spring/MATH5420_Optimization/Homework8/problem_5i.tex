Write the first- and second-order necessary conditions for a local solution.

\begin{solution}
    The gradient and Hessian of $f$ are given by:

    $$
    \nabla f(x) = c, \quad \nabla^2 f = 0.
    $$

    The first-order condition for a local minimizer $x_*$ requires that there exists a vector $\lambda_*$ of Lagrange 
    multipliers such that 

    $$
    A^T \lambda_* = \nabla f(x_*) = c.
    $$
    
    where $\lambda_* \ge 0$ and $\lambda_*^T (A x_* - b) = 0$. The second-order necessary condition for a local 
    minimizer requires that $Z^T \nabla^2 f(x_*) Z$ be positive semidefinite, where $Z$ is a null-space matrix for the 
    matrix of active constraints at $x_*$. In particular, because $\nabla^2 f = 0$, the second-order necessary condition
    is trivially true at all points $x$ since $x^T Z^T \nabla^2 f(x_*) Z x = 0 \ge 0$.
