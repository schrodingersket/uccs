Consider the linear program

\begin{mini*}
  {}{z = x_1 - x_2}{}{}
  \addConstraint{-x_1 + x_2}{\le 1}
  \addConstraint{x_1 - 2x_2}{\le 2}
  \addConstraint{x_1, x_2}{\geq 0}.
\end{mini*}

Derive an expression for the set of optimal solutions to this problem, and show that this set is unbounded.

\begin{solution}
  We represent this system in standard form as $Ax = b$, where

  $$
  A = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    -1 &  1 & 1 & 0 \\
     1 & -2 & 0 & 1 \\
  \end{pmatrix*}, \quad b = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    1 \\
    2
  \end{pmatrix*}, \quad x = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    x_3 \\
    x_4
  \end{pmatrix*}, \quad c = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
     1 \\
    -1 \\
     0 \\
     0
  \end{pmatrix*}.
  $$

  With $x_B = \{x_2, x_4\}$ and $x_N = \{x_1, x_3\}$, we have:\footnote{
    We apply the simplex algorithm in \texttt{problem\_2.py} with the initial basis $x_B = \{x_3, x_4\}$ corresponding 
    to our slack variables. This yields the optimal basis $x_B' = \{x_2, x_4\}$ after a single iteration, and so we 
    start with that basis for this problem for simplicity.
  }

  $$
    B = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
       1 & 0 \\
      -2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix*}, \quad B^{-1} = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
       1 & 0 \\
       2 & 1
    \end{pmatrix*}, \quad N = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      -1 & 1 \\
       1 & 0
    \end{pmatrix*}, \quad c_B = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      -1 \\
       0
    \end{pmatrix*}, \quad c_N = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      1 \\
      0
    \end{pmatrix*}.
  $$

  Our reduced cost vector is given by:

  $$
  \hat{c}_N^T = c_N^T  - c_B^T B^{-1} N = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    0 \\
    1
  \end{pmatrix*}
  $$

  The first entry of $\hat{c}_N^T$ corresponds to the amount by which the objective function changes when $x_1$ is
  increased; since this value is 0, increasing $x_1$ has no effect on the objective value. We now consider how much 
  $x_1$ may be increased without violating a nonnegativity constraint. The column of $A$ corresponding to $x_1$ is given
  by $A_1^T = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
    -1 & 1
  \end{pmatrix*}$, and so

  $$ 
    \hat{A}_1 = B^{-1}A_1 = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      -1 \\
      -1
    \end{pmatrix*}.
  $$ 

  Since each entry in $\hat{A}_2$ is negative, we may increase $x_1$ by any amount without violating nonnegativity 
  conditions of $x_B$; moreover, because varying $x_1$ has no effect on the objective function, the feasible region for 
  this problem is unbounded above with respect to $x_1$. From the equation $x_B = B^{-1}b - \hat{A}_1 x_1$, we conclude
  that all points of the form

  $$
    \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      x_1 \\
      x_2 \\
      x_3 \\
      x_4
    \end{pmatrix*} = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      0 \\
      1 \\
      0 \\
      4
    \end{pmatrix*} + \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
      1 \\
      1 \\
      0 \\
      1
    \end{pmatrix*} x_1
  $$

  are feasible solutions; from the above argument, we observe that variation in $x_1$ has no effect on the objective and
  so the above set of points represents all optimal solutions to this program. In the two-variable formulation, the
  above system becomes

  $$
  \left\{ (x_1, x_2) \mid x_2 = 1 + x_1, x_1 \ge 0 \right\}.
  $$

  which we also observe graphically in Figure \ref{fig:problem_2_feasible_region} below.
