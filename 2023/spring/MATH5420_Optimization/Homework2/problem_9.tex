Let $A$ be a given $m \times n$ matrix and let $Z$ be a null-space matrix for $A$. Let $X$ be an invertible $m \times m$
matrix and let $Y$ be an invertible $n \times n$ matrix. If a change of variable is made to transform $A$ into 
$\hat{A} = XAY$, how can $Z$ be transformed into $\hat{Z}$ so that $\hat{Z}$ is also a null-space matrix for $\hat{A}$?
