\textbf{Griva, Nash, Sofer 4.3.13}

Suppose that a linear program includes a free variable $x_i$. In converting this problem to standard form, $x_i$ is
replaced by a pair of non-negative variables:

$$
x_i = x_i' - x_i'', \quad x_i', x_i'' \geq 0.
$$

Prove that no basic feasible solution can include both $x_i'$ and $x_i''$ as basic variables.
