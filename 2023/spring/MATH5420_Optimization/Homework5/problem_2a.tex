via the two-phase method.

\begin{solution}
  We begin by converting the problem to standard form by introducing the slack variable $x_4$:

  \begin{mini*}
    {}{z = -4x_1 - 2x_2 - 8x_3}{}{}
    \addConstraint{2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 + x_4}{= 30}
    \addConstraint{x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3}{= 40}
    \addConstraint{x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4}{\geq 0}.
  \end{mini*}

  To find a basic feasible solution for this problem, we first note that choosing $x_4$ as a basic variable yields a
  feasible value $x_4 = 30$. Since our system only contains two constraints, we need only introduce a single artificial 
  variable $a_1$ into our second constraint in order to construct a feasible basis for the auxiliary problem. This 
  yields our auxiliary (phase I) problem:

  \begin{mini*}
    {}{z' = a_1}{}{}
    \addConstraint{2x_1 - x_2 + 3x_3 + x_4}{= 30}
    \addConstraint{x_1 + 2x_2 + 4x_3 + a_1}{= 40}
    \addConstraint{x_i, a_i}{\geq 0}.
  \end{mini*}

  We solve this auxiliary system via the simplex method in \texttt{problem\_2a.py} to find our desired basis 
  $x_B = (x_3, x_4)^T$ which corresponds to the basic feasible solution $x = \left(0, 0, 10, 0, 0\right)^T$ (and yields 
  $z' = 0$, as desired).
 
  With $x_B$ as our initial basis for the original problem, the simplex algorithm yields the optimal solution 
  $z = -160$ with $x_B = (x_1, x_4)$ at the point \linebreak
  $x = (40, 0, 0, -50)^T$.
