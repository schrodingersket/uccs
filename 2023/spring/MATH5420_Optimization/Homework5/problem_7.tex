Prove that if $x$ is a feasible solution to the primal, $y$ is a feasible solution to the dual, and $c^Tx = b^Ty$, then
$x$ and $y$ are optimal for their respective problems.

\begin{solution}
  Let $x$ be any feasible solution to the primal problem in standard form, $y$ be any feasible solution to the 
  corresponding dual problem, and suppose that $c^Tx = b^Ty$. We denote the optimal feasible solutions to the primal and
  dual problems by $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$, respectively. Since the primal is a minimization problem, we have 
  $c^T\hat{x} \le c^Tx$. Similarly, since the dual problem is a maximization problem, we have $b^T \hat{y} \ge b^T y$. 
  We combine these inequalities with our assumption that $c^Tx = b^Ty$ to find:

  $$
  c^T \hat{x} \le c^T x = b^T y \le b^T \hat{y}.
  $$

  Moreover, because $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{y}$ are feasible solutions to their respective problems, weak duality guarantees
  that $c^T \hat{x} \ge b^T \hat{y}$. Hence $c^T \hat{x} = c^T x = b^T y = b^T \hat{y}$, and so $x$ and $y$ are optimal
  for their respective problems, as desired.
