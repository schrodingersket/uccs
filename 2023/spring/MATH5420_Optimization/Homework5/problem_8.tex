Consider a linear program with a single constraint

\begin{mini*}
  {}{z = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n{c_i x_i}}{}{}
  \addConstraint{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n{a_i x_i}}{\le b}
  \addConstraint{x_i}{\ge 0}.
\end{mini*}

Using duality, develop a simple rule to determine an optimal solution, if the latter exists.

\begin{solution}
  We first observe that the primal problem is in canonical form, save for the direction of the inequality within the
  single constraint. The dual problem will therefore be in canonical form for a maximization problem, with the exception
  that the new variable $y_1$ is nonpositive. The dual problem is given by 
  \begin{maxi*}
    {}{w = b^T y = b y_1}{}{}
    \addConstraint{a_i y_1}{\le c_i, \quad i = 1, \ldots, n}
    \addConstraint{y_1}{\le 0}.
  \end{maxi*}

  To solve this problem, we first suppose $b \le 0$. In this case, our objective is maximized when $y_1$ is minimized,
  and so we choose

  $$
  y_1 = \min\limits_{i = 1, ..., n}{\left\{ \frac{c_i}{a_i}  \biggm|  a_i y_1 \le c_i, \frac{c_i}{a_i} \le 0 \right\}}.
  $$

  Similarly, when $b \ge 0$, our objective function is maximized when $y_1$ is maximized. In this case, we let
  
  $$
  y_1 = \max\limits_{i = 1, ..., n}{\left\{ \frac{c_i}{a_i}  \biggm|  a_i y_1 \le c_i, \frac{c_i}{a_i} \le 0 \right\}}.
  $$

  Assuming that such a $y_1$ exists, strong duality guarantees that the resulting optimal solution $w = b y_1$ to the
  dual problem is also the optimal solution to the primal problem, i.e., $w = b y_1 = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n{c_i x_i} = z$.
