        \item Neural networks are capable of solving classical PDE problems (i.e., with BCs and ICs).
        \item PINNs can incorporate experimental observations into PDE residual minimization.
        \item Our PINN correctly identified the bathymetry function shape and scale from experimental observations of 
              wave height and velocity alone.
