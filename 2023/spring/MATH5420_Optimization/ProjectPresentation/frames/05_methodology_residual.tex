    \frametitle{Methodology: Residual}

    We need a couple more pieces before we frame this as an unconstrained optimization problem. First, we substitute 
    our approximation function into the SWE system.

    Since we're only approximating the solution, we expect there to be some amount ``left over", which we call the 
    \textit{residual} and denote $R$.

    The first equation in the system 
    
    $$
    h_t + (hv)_x = 0
    $$
    
    yields the residual term associated with conservation of mass:

    $$
    \left( \mathcal{N}_h \right)_t + \left( \mathcal{N}_h \mathcal{N}_v \right)_x = R_{mass}(x, t).
    $$

    The residual term associated with the momentum is similarly obtained from the second equation, which we denote 
    $R_{momentum}$.
