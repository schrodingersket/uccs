    \frametitle{Results: Homogeneous System}

    We apply this methodology to the homogeneous system, where friction is negligible and our bathymetry function 
    $\beta(x)$ is zero so that fluid flows over a flat surface.  We impose periodic boundary conditions, no initial 
    velocity, and the following sinusoidal initial condition

    $$
    h(x, 0) = 2 + \sin{\left( \frac{\pi x}{100} \right)}
    $$

    where $x \in [0, 200]$ and $t \in [0, 15]$.

    After 50,000 Adam iterations and 12,000 L-BFGS iterations, we obtain a mean PDE residual (over a randomly sampled 
    subset $\Omega$ of our domain) of 
    
    $$
    \lVert R(\Omega) \rVert_2 = 0.006090.
    $$

    We call the resulting neural network solution a \textit{physics-informed neural network} (PINN).
