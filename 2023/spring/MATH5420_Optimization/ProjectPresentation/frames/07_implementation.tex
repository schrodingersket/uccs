    Neural networks fit the bill! What are they?

    \medskip
    \pause

    A (feedforward) neural network is an affine composition (e.g., $f(g(x)) = m g(x) + b$) of multivariate ``squashing''
    functions, such as the sigmoid or hyperbolic tangent functions. 
   
    \bigskip
    \pause More importantly, for particular choices of ``squashing" functions, neural networks are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{1.5em}
        \item Universal function approximators (for Borel-measurable functions over compact domains).
        \item Analytic (and therefore infinitely differentiable).
        \item Trainable via gradient descent (by modifying the coefficients $m$ and $b$ of the affine maps).
    \end{itemize}
