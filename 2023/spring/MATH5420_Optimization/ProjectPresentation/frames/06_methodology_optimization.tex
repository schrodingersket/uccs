    We find the best approximation to the true solution by solving the non-linear unconstrained minimization problem:

    $$
    \min_{\mathcal{N}} {\lVert R_{mass} \rVert + \lVert R_{momentum} \rVert}.
    $$

    At this point, we have a well-defined optimization problem, but we still need to decide what our approximation 
    function $\mathcal{N}$ ``looks like".

    Ideally, we'd like a function which is ``universal" to some degree and can modified to minimize the PDE residual via 
    existing optimization algorithms. \only<+->\footnote{
        In the context of analysis, we'd say that our solution surrogate $\mathcal{N}$ should be dense in the 
        appropriate Sobolev space for this system.
