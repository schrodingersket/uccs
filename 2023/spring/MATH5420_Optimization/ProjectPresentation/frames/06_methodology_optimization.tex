    We find the best approximation to the true solution by solving the non-linear unconstrained minimization problem:

    $$
    \min_{\mathcal{N}} {\lVert R_{mass} \rVert + \lVert R_{momentum} \rVert}.
    $$

    At this point, we have a well-defined optimization problem, but we still need to decide what our approximation 
    function $\mathcal{N}$ "looks like".

    Ideally, we'd like a function which can modified to minimize the PDE residual via existing optimization algorithms.
