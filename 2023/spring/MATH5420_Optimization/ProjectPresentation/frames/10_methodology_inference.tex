    In Appendix A, we successfully solve the classical homogeneous system with fluid flow over a flat surface.

    Let's try something more difficult. Based on some experimental height and velocity measurements, could a neural 
    network ``see'' under the fluid surface to infer the bathymetry function $\beta(x)$ when it's not known in advance?

    For this problem, we'll choose our neural network to be a mapping from 
    $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$:

    $$
    \mathcal{N}(x, t) = \begin{pmatrix*}
        \mathcal{N}_h \\
        \mathcal{N}_v \\
        \mathcal{N}_{\beta}
    \end{pmatrix*} \approx \begin{pmatrix*}
        h \\
        v \\
        \beta
    \end{pmatrix*}.
    $$
