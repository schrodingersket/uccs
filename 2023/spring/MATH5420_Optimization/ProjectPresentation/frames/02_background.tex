    We explore this question in the context of the 1D Shallow-Water Equations (SWE).

    The SWEs are a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDE) which represent a simplified model of fluid
    flow.

    These equations are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations where the horizontal length scale is
    much greater than the vertical length scale (e.g., oceanic modeling, river flow, flood waves, etc.).
