Under what conditions on $Q$ does a local minimizer exist?

\begin{solution}
    A local minimizer of $f$ exists whenever $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is positive definite; since the Hessian of a quadratic
    function is given by

    $$
    \nabla^2 f(x) = Q + Q^T
    $$

    a local minimizer exists whenever $Q + Q^T$ is positive definite (and therefore only has strictly positive 
    eigenvalues).
