Under what conditions on $Q$ does $f$ have a stationary point, but no local minimia or maxima?

\begin{solution}
    From the second-order necessary condition for a minimizer, $f$ has a stationary point but no minima or maxima 
    when the condition from (i) holds and $\nabla^2 f(x) = Q + Q^T$ is neither positive definite nor negative definite,
    i.e., when $Q + Q^T$ is indefinite (and therefore has both positive and negative eigenvalues).
