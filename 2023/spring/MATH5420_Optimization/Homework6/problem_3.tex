Use Newton's method to find a minimum of the following function:

$$
f(x) = 5x^5 + 2x^3 - 4x^2 - 3x + 2
$$

in the interval $-2 \le x \le 2$.

\begin{solution}
    We utilize Newton's method with initial guess $x_0 = 1$ to find a zero of the gradient of $f$, which is given by:

    $$
    \nabla f = 25 x^4 + 6x^2 - 8x - 3.
    $$

    We implement this algorithm in \texttt{newton\_raphson.py} (which is called by 
    \texttt{problem\_3.py}) to obtain the root $x_0 = 0.68989795$ after 5 iterations. We show the output of this script 
    in Figure \ref{fig:problem_3}:

        Root identified at x = [ 0.68989795]
        Minimum value at root is f = -0.5353664979659847
        Gradient at root is given by [-2.6645352591003757e-15]
        Hessian at root is given by [33.1151015307185]

    The second derivative of $f$ is given by:

    $$
    \nabla^2 f = 100 x^3 + 12x - 8
    $$

    which takes the value $\nabla^2 f = 100 x^3 + 12x - 8 \approx 33.115 > 0$ at $x = x_0$ and so $x_0$ is a local 
    minimizer of $f$; this minimum of $f$ is given by $f(x_0) \approx -0.53537$.
