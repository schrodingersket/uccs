Determine the stationary point, denoted $x_*$. What is the value of the objective function at the stationary point?

\begin{solution}
  The point $x_*$ is a stationary point when when $\nabla f(x_*) = 0$. From (b), we have

  $$
  0 = \nabla f = 2A^T (Ax - b)
  $$

  and hence any $x_*$ which satisfies

  $$
  A^T A x_* = A^T b
  $$

  is a stationary point. Furthermore, when $A^T A$ is nonsingular, $x_*$ is uniquely determined by 
  $x_* = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b$. At this stationary point, the objective function $f$ takes the value

  $$
  f(x_*) = \lVert Ax - b \rVert^2 = \lVert A \left( A^T A \right)^{-1} A^T b - b\rVert^2.
  $$
