Determine the stationary point, denoted $x_*$. What is the value of the objective function at the stationary point?

\begin{solution}
  Our stationary point is achieved when $\nabla f = 0$. From (b), we have

  $$
  0 = \nabla f = 2A^T (Ax - b)
  $$

  and hence our stationary point is the solution to 

  $$
  A^T A x_* = A^T b.
  $$

  Moreover, when $A^T A$ is nonsingular, $x_*$ is uniquely determined by $x_* = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T b$.
  At this stationary point, the objective function $f$ takes the value

  $$
  f(x_*) = \lVert Ax - b \rVert^2 = \lVert A \left( A^T A \right)^{-1} A^T b - b\rVert^2.
  $$
