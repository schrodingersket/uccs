Prescribe a set of conditions on the matrix $A$ to guarantee a unique minimizer. Be as specific as possible.

\begin{solution}
  From part (e), we are guaranteed a unique minimizer when $A^T A$ is positive definite, i.e., whenever 
  $x^T A^T A x = (A^T x)^T (A^T x) > 0$ for every nonzero $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. We observe that 
  $(A^T x)^T (A^T x) = \left\lVert A^T x \right\rVert^2_2$, and so $A^T A$ is positive definite precisely when $A^T$ has a trivial
  null space. We are therefore guaranteed a unique minimizer whenever $A$ has full row rank.
