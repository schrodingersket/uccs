Write down a linear program describing this problem with weekly revenue as the objective function.

\begin{solution}
  Let $x_1$ represent the number of basic bikes assembled and $x_2$ the number of deluxe bikes. We wish to maximize
  total revenue, which is given by \linebreak
  $r = 100 x_1 + 200 x_2$. When we account for constraints on parts costs and labor hours, our system becomes

  \begin{mini*}
    {}{-z = -100 x_1 - 200 x_2}{}{}
    \addConstraint{2 x_1 + 3 x_2}{\le 11}
    \addConstraint{50 x_1 + 150 x_2}{\le 500}.
  \end{mini*}
\end{solution}
