Write down the dual problem.

\begin{solution}
  We write the dual of the transformed system. Recall from (a) that the transformed system is given by

  \begin{mini*}
      {}{\tilde{z} = x_1' - x_2'}{}{}
      \addConstraint{x_1' + x_2'}{\le 2}
      \addConstraint{x_1', x_2'}{\ge 0}.
  \end{mini*}

  The first (and only) constraint in the primal problem is opposite canonical form for a minimization problem; hence the
  dual variable $y_1$ is nonpositive. All variable constraints in the primal are consistent with canonical form, so the
  constraints in the dual will be consistent as well. We may therefore write the dual problem as

  \begin{maxi*}
    {}{w = b^T y = 2 y_1}{}{}
    \addConstraint{ y_1 }{\le -1}
    \addConstraint{ y_1 }{\le 1}
    \addConstraint{y_1}{\le 0}.
  \end{maxi*}

  where the constraints adhere to $A^T y \le c^T$ where $A$ represents the constraint matrix of the primal and $c$ the
  cost vector.
