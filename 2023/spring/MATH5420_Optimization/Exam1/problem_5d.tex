Write down the dual problem.

\begin{solution}
  We write the dual of the transformed system. Recall from (a) that the transformed system is given by

  \begin{mini*}
      {}{\tilde{z} = x_1' - x_2'}{}{}
      \addConstraint{x_1' + x_2'}{\le 2}
      \addConstraint{x_1', x_2'}{\ge 0}.
  \end{mini*}

  The first (and only) constraint in the primal problem is opposite canonical form for a minimization problem; hence the
  dual variable $y_1$ is nonpositive. All variable constraints in the primal are consistent with canonical form, so the
  constraints in the dual will also be consistent with canonical form. The dual problem is therefore:

  \begin{maxi*}
    {}{w = b^T y = 2 y_1}{}{}
    \addConstraint{ y_1 }{\le -1}
    \addConstraint{ y_1 }{\le 1}
    \addConstraint{y_1}{\le 0}.
  \end{maxi*}

  The constraints adhere to $A^T y \le c^T$ where $A$ represents the constraint matrix of the primal problem and $c$ the
  primal cost vector.
