Suppose that $A^T A$ is positive definite. Prove that the stationary point is a unique minimizer.

\begin{solution}
  From part (b), we have that $\nabla^2 f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R} = 2 A^T A$. Since $A^T A$ is positive definite 
  everywhere, the Hessian of $f$ is positive definite over $\mathbb{R}^n$ and so our stationary point must be a local 
  minimizer of $f$. Furthermore, since $\nabla^2 f$ is positive definite over the convex set $\mathbb{R}^n$, our 
  objective function $f$ is strictly convex and so our local minimizer must also be the unique global minimizer of $f$.
