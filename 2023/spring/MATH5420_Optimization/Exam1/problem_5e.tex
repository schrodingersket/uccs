What is the optimal solution of the dual problem? Show that the optimal solution satisfies strong
duality.

\begin{solution}
  Since the dual problem is a maximization problem of the single variable $y_1$, the optimal solution occurs when $y_1$
  is maximized. From our constraints, the greatest value $y_1$ can take is $-1$, which yields the objective value 
  $w = 2y_1 = -2$ and agrees with the optimal value $\tilde{z} = -2$ of the primal problem.
\end{solution}
