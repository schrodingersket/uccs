\textbf{Griva, Nash, Sofer 2.6.1}

Find the first four terms of the Taylor series for 

$$
  f(x) = \log{(1 + x)}
$$

about the point $x_0 = 0$. Evaluate the series for $p = 0.1$ and $p = 0.01$ and compare 
with the corresponding analytic values. Derive the remainder form of the Taylor series 
using five terms (i.e., the four terms already derived and a remainder term). Derive
a bound on the accuracy of the four-term series. Compare the derived bound with the
actual errors for $p = 0.1$ and $p = 0.01$.
