\textbf{Griva, Nash, Sofer 2.3.20}

Determine whether

$$
  f(x) = 2x_1^2 - 3 x_1 x_2 + 5 x_2^2 - 2 x_1 + 6 x_2
$$

is convex, concave, both, or neither for $x \in \mathbb{R}^2$.

\begin{solution}
  We first note that $f$ is non-linear and hence by 2.3.5 cannot be both convex and concave.
  Moreover, because $f(x)$ is a real polynomial in $x_1$ and $x_2$, it is smooth and hence 
  we may take its Hessian (by way of the gradient):
  
  $$
    \nabla f(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
      4x_1 - 3x_2 - 2 \\
      -3x_1 + 10x_2 + 6
    \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  $$
    \nabla^2 f(x) = \begin{pmatrix}
      4  & -3 \\
      -3 & 10
    \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  The spectrum of $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is \footnote{
    approximately; see \texttt{problem\_7.py}.
  } given by $\Lambda = \{2.75, 11.24 \}$; since all eigenvalues are positive, 
  the Hessian matrix is positive definite and $f$ is therefore convex\footnote{
    See Griva, Nash, Sofer 2.6.8
  }. Furthermore, since $f$ cannot be both convex and concave, $f$ is not concave.
