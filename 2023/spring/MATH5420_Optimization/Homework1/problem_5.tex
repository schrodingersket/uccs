\textbf{Griva, Nash, Sofer 2.3.3}

Consider a feasible region $S$ defined by a set of linear constraints 
$S = \left\{ x \mid Ax \le b \right\}$ where $A \in M_{n \times n}(\mathbb{R})$.
Prove that $S$ is convex.

\begin{solution}
  Let $S_i = \left\{ x \mid A_i x \le b_i \right\}$ represent the feasible set for the linear 
  constraint obtained by multiplying the $i^{th}$ row of $A$ by $x$ and imposing that this sum
  be less than the correponding $i^{th}$ element of $b$. Then $A_i x \le b_i$ is of the form 
  $c^T x \le b$ and is convex by the result proved in 2.3.2. Moreover, we may write $S$ thusly:
 
  $$
    S = \left\{ x \mid Ax \le b \right\} 
      = \bigcap_{i=1}^n{\left\{ x \mid A_i x \le b_i \right\}} 
      = \bigcap_{i=1}^n{S_i}
  $$

  where $I = \{ k \}_{k=1}^n$. Since the finite intersection of convex sets is convex, we see
  that $S$ is convex, as desired.
