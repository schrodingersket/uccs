\textbf{Griva, Nash, Sofer 2.4.2}

Find all descent directions for the linear function $f(x) = x_1 - 2x_2 + 3x_2$. Does your
answer depend on the value of $x$?

\begin{solution}
  Recall that for a linear function $f(x) = c^Tx$, $p_k$ is a descent direction if

  \begin{equation}\label{eq:4}
    c^T p_k < 0.
  \end{equation}

  Observe that we may write $f(x)$ as follows:

  $$
  f(x) = c^T x
  $$
  
  where
  
  $$
  c = \begin{pmatrix}
     1 \\
    -2 \\
     3
  \end{pmatrix}
  \text{ and }
  x = \begin{pmatrix}
    x_1 \\
    x_2 \\
    x_3
  \end{pmatrix}
  $$

  and hence $f$ is linear. By (\ref{eq:4}), the descent directions of $f$ 
  are precisely those $p_k$ for which $c^T p_k < 0$ or, in other words, when 
  $p_1 - 2p_2 + 3p_3 < 0$ where $p_i$ are the components of $p$. We note 
  further that neither $c$ nor $p_k$ depend on $x$, and so this holds  
  irrespective of the value of $x$.
