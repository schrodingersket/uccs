Let $f:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function. Prove that $f$ is convex and concave if
and only if $f(x) = c^T x$ for some constant vector $c$.

\begin{solution}
  Suppose first that $f$ is convex and concave, and let $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
  Since $f$ convex over a convex set \footnote{
    $\mathbb{R}^n$ is convex since it is closed under arbitrary linear combinations.
  }, the following holds:

  \begin{equation}
    f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y) \le \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y).
  \end{equation}

  Similarly, since $f$ is also concave, $-f$ is convex and so we have

  $$
    -f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y) \le \alpha -f(x) + (1 - \alpha) -f(y).
  $$

  Multiplying through by $-1$ yields

  $$
    f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y) \ge \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y)
  $$

  which combined with (1) gives equality:
  
  $$
    f(\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)y) = \alpha f(x) + (1 - \alpha) f(y)
  $$

  We now show that this equality implies that $f$ is linear (and hence that $f = c^T x$ for some
  constant $c \in \mathbb{R}^n$).
