Suppose that the function is minimized starting from $x_0 = (0, -2)^T$. Verify that $p_0 = (0, 1)^T$ is a direction of 
descent.

\begin{solution}
    We first observe that $f(x_0) = f(0, -2) = 4$. We move from $x_0$ in the direction of $p_0$ with step size 
    $\alpha = 1$ to find:

    $$
    f(x_0 + \alpha p_0) = f(0, -1) = 1.
    $$

    Hence

    $$
    f(x_0 + \alpha p_0) = 1 < 4 = f(x_0)
    $$

    and so $p_0$ is a direction of descent.
