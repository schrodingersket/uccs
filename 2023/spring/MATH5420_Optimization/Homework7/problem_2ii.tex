Suppose that a line search is used to minimize the function $F(\alpha) = f(x_0 + \alpha p_0)$, and that a backtracking
line search is used to find the optimal step length $\alpha$. Does $\alpha = 1$ satisfy the sufficient decrease 
condition for $\mu = 0.5$? For what values of $\mu$ does $\alpha = 1$ satisfy the sufficient decrease condition?
