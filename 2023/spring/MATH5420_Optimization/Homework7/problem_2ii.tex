Suppose that a line search is used to minimize the function $F(\alpha) = f(x_0 + \alpha p_0)$, and that a backtracking
line search is used to find the optimal step length $\alpha$. Does $\alpha = 1$ satisfy the sufficient decrease 
condition for $\mu = 0.5$? For what values of $\mu$ does $\alpha = 1$ satisfy the sufficient decrease condition?

\begin{solution}
    We first observe that

    $$
    F(\alpha) = f(x_0 + \alpha p_0) = f(0, -2 + \alpha) = (-2 + \alpha)^2.
    $$

    so that the first and second derivatives with respect to $\alpha$ are given by

    $$
    F'(\alpha) = 2(-2 + \alpha), \quad F''(\alpha) = 2,
    $$

    respectively. Setting $F'(\alpha) = 0$ yields the stationary point $\alpha = 2$; in particular, since 
    $F''(\alpha) = 2 > 0 $ for all $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$, we have that $\alpha = 2$ is a local minimum of $F(\alpha)$.
    With the observation that $F(\alpha)$ is a quadratic function (and therefore convex over $\mathbb{R})$, we have 
    that $\alpha = 2$ is the global minimum of $F(\alpha)$ with minimum value $F(2) = 0$.

    To satisfy the sufficient decrease condition for $\mu = 0.5$, the trial step $\alpha = 1$ must satisfy the Armijo 
    condition:

    $$
    f(x + \alpha p) \le f(x) + \mu \alpha p^T \nabla f(x)
    $$

    The gradient of $f$ is given by:

    $$
    \nabla f = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
         4 x_1 - 2 x_2 + 6 x_1^2 + 4 x_1^3  \\
         2 x_2 - 2 x_1
    \end{pmatrix*}
    $$

    For $\mu = 0.5$, we have:
    
    $$
    f(x) + \mu \alpha p^T \nabla f(x) = f(0, -2) + \mu \cdot \begin{pmatrix*}[r] 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix*} \begin{pmatrix*}[r] 4 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix*} = 4 - 4 \mu = 2
    $$

    and since $f(x + \alpha p) = F(\alpha) = f(x + p) = (-2 + 1)^2 = 1$, we find that $\alpha = 1$ satisfies the 
    sufficient decrease condition. To determine all values of $\mu$ for which $\alpha = 1$ satisfies the sufficient 
    decrease condition, we solve the Armijo condition for $\mu$:

    $$
    1 \le 4 - 4 \mu
    $$

    from which we obtain the condition

    $$
    0 < \mu \le \frac{3}{4}.
    $$
