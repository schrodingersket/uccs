Prove that $x_*$ is a strict minimizer.

\begin{solution}
    Since our Lagrangian is a quadratic form with positive definite matrix $I$, (so that the Hessian
    $\nabla^2_{xx} \mathcal{L} = I$) we know that $x_*$ from (a) is a local minimizer of $f$; moreover, since 
    $\mathcal{L}$ is strictly convex, we further have that $x_*$ is the unique strict global minimizer of $f$.
