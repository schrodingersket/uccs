Use part (a) to find the point on the line $x_2 = 1 + x_1$ which is closest to the point $r = (-1, 1)^T$.

\begin{solution}
    Since $-x_1 + x_2 = 1$, we have that 

    $$
    a = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
        -1 \\
        1
    \end{pmatrix*}, \quad b = 1, \quad \text{and} \quad r = \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
        -1 \\
        1
    \end{pmatrix*}.
    $$

    By part (a), we have that the point on the line $x_2 = 1 + x_1$ which is closest to $r$ (that is, which minimizes
    the square of the distance between $x$ and $r$) is given by

    \begin{align*}
       x_* &= r + \frac{b - a^T r}{a^T a} a \\
           &= \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
                -1 \\
                 1
              \end{pmatrix*} + \frac{1 - 2}{2} \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
                -1 \\
                 1
              \end{pmatrix*} \\
           &= \begin{pmatrix*}[r]
                -\sfrac{1}{2} \\
                 \sfrac{1}{2}
              \end{pmatrix*}.
    \end{align*}

    \ \\
