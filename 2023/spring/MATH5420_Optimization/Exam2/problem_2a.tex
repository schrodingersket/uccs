Show that the gradient at $x_0$ is $\nabla f(x_0) = \lambda v$.


\begin{solution}
    We assume without loss of generality that $Q$ is symmetric.\footnote{
        As discussed in lecture.
    } The gradient of our objective function is therefore

    $$
    \nabla f(x) = Q x - c.
    $$

    Since $x_*$ is a stationary point, we know that $\nabla f(x_*) = Q x_* - c = 0$. Moreover, since $v$ is an 
    eigenvector of $Q$, $Q v = \lambda v$. Hence at $x_0 = x_* + v$, our gradient becomes

    \begin{align*}
        \nabla f(x_0) &= \nabla f(x_* + v) \\
        &= Q (x_* + v) - c \\
        &= Q x_* + Q v - c \\
        &= Q x_* - c + \lambda v \\
        &= \lambda v,
    \end{align*}

    as desired.
