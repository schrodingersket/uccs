For which value of $m$ does $p$ satisfy the gradient-related criteria?

\begin{solution}
    The gradient-related criteria is satisfied for $p$ at $x$ whenever

    $$
    \lVert p \rVert \ge m \lVert \nabla f(x) \rVert
    $$

    from which we obtain

    $$
    m \le \frac{\lVert p \rVert}{\lVert \nabla f(x) \rVert} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\left(\frac{201}{5}\right)} \approx 0.035179
    $$

    so that the gradient-related criteria is satisfied when $m \le 0.035179$.
