Prove that when the steepest-descent direction is used, the step length which minimizes $f$ in this direction is 
$\alpha_0 = \lambda^{-1}$.

\begin{solution}
    Since our objective function is quadratic, the steepest-descent direction at $x$ is given by

    $$
    p = - \nabla f(x) = - \lambda v.
    $$

    We use an exact line search to find the step length $\alpha_0$ which minimizes $f$ in this direction. For a quadratic
    objective function, this step length is given by

    \begin{align*}
        \alpha_0 &= -\frac{\nabla f(x_0)^T p_0}{p_0^T Q p_0} \\
                 &= -\frac{\lambda v^T \left( -\lambda v \right)}{-\lambda v^T Q (-\lambda v)} \\
                 &= \frac{\lambda^2 \lVert v \rVert}{\lambda^2 v^T Q v} \\
                 &= \frac{\lVert v \rVert}{\lambda v^T v} \\
                 &= \frac{1}{\lambda}
    \end{align*}

    as desired.
