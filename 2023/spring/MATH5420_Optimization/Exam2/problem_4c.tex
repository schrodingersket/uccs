Add the points from (b) to the sketch of the feasible region.

\begin{solution}
    The feasible region and all stationary points is plotted below in Figure \ref{fig:problem_4c}; the feasible region 
    is represented by the shaded region. Stationary points and curves are represented in red and level curves of the 
    objective function are represented in green. The horizontal axis represents $x_1$ and the vertical axis represents 
    $x_2$.
