Confirm this result for the function 

$$
f(x) = 3 x_1^2 - 2 x_1 x_2 + 3 x_2^2 + 2 x_1 - 6 x_2.
$$

Use $x_0 = (1, 2)^T$ as a starting point for the method and compute the point obtained by one iteration of the 
steepest-descent algorithm. Prove that this point is the unique minimum $x_*$ and verify that $x_0 - x_*$ is an
eigenvector of the Hessian matrix.
