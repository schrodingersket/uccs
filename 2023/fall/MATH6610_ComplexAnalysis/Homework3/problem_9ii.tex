If $|f(z)| \ge 1$ whenever $|z| = 1$ and there exists a point $z_0 \in \mathbb{D}$ such that $|f(z_0)| < 1$, 
then the image of $f$ contains the unit disc.

\begin{solution}
    By the same argument as in (a), it suffices once more to show that $f(z) = 0$ has a zero in the unit disc 
    $\mathbb{D}$. We suppose again for the sake of contradiction that it does not so that $\sfrac{1}{f(z)}$ is 
    holomorphic in $\mathbb{D}$.

    Since $|f(z)| \ge 1$ on the unit circle $C$, we have that $\sfrac{1}{|f(z)|} \le 1$ on $C$. We apply the maximum 
    modulus principle once more to find that

    $$
    \frac{1}{|f(z)|} < 1, \quad z \in \mathbb{D}
    $$

    from which we conclude that $|f(z)| > 1$ for all $z \in \mathbb{D}$. Since there exists some $z_0 \in \mathbb{D}$ 
    such that $|f(z_0)| < 1$ by hypothesis, we obtain the desired contradiction and therefore conclude that $f(z)$ must 
    have a zero in $\mathbb{D}$. By the same argument as before, the image of $f$ contains the unit disc.
