\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 3.1}

Using Euler's formula

$$
\sin{\pi z} = \frac{e^{i \pi x} - e^{-i \pi x}}{2i}
$$

show that the complex zeros of $\sin{\pi z}$ are exactly at the integers, and that they are each of order $1$. Calculate
the residue of $\sfrac{1}{\sin{\pi z}}$ at $z = n \in \mathbb{Z}$.
