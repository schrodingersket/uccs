\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 2.7}

Suppose $f : \mathbb{D} \to \mathbb{C}$ is holomorphic. Show that the diameter 
$d = \sup_{z,w \in \mathbb{D}} |f(z) - f(w)|$ of the image of $f$ satisfies

$$
2 \left| f'(0) \right| \le d.
$$

Moreover, it can be shown that equality holds precisely when $f$ is affine, i.e., $f(z) = a_0 + a_1 z$.
