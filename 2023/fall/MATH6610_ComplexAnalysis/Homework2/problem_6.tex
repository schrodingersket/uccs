\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 2.6}

Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of $\mathbb{C}$ and let $T \in \Omega$ be a triangle whose interior is also contained in 
$\Omega$. Suppose that $f$ is a function which is holomorphic in $\Omega$ except possibly at a point $w$ inside $T$. 
Prove that if $f$ is bounded near $w$, then

$$
\int_T f(z) \; dz = 0.
