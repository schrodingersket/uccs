\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 2.15}
Suppose $f$ is a non-vanishing continuous function on $\closeD$ which is holomorphic in $\mathbb{D}$. Prove
that if

$$
\left| f(z) \right| = 1 \quad \text{whenever} \; |z| = 1,
$$

then $f$ is constant.

\begin{solution}
    Consider the function

    $$
    \tilde{f}(z) = \begin{cases}
        f(z), &|z| \le 1, \\
        1 / \overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z}})}, &|z| > 1.
    \end{cases}
    $$

    Our aim is to show that $\tilde{f}$ is entire and bounded so that it (and therefore 
    $f = \tilde{f}\vert_{\closeD}$) is constant by Liouville's Theorem. We first show that $\tilde{f}$ is 
    continuous on $\mathbb{C}$. When $|z| > 1$ (i.e., $z, \bar{z} \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \overline{\mathbb{D}})$, we have

    $$
    \left| \frac{1}{\bar{z}} \right| = \frac{1}{|z|} < 1,
    $$

    so that $\overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z}})}$ is never zero (for if $\overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_0}})} = 0$ 
    for some $|z_0| > 1$, we would have 
    $0 = \overline{0} = \overline{\overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_0}})}} = f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_0}})$, which
    contradicts the fact that $f$ is non-vanishing on $\closeD$). We consider an arbitrary sequence $\left\{z_n\right\}$ 
    outside the disc $\closeD$ such that $|z_n| \to 1$ (and hence $\left|\overline{z_n}\right| \to 1$); the reciprocal 
    of this sequence corresponds to a sequence $\left\{ \sfrac{1}{z_n} \right\}$ entirely contained inside $\closeD$ 
    such that $\left| \sfrac{1}{z_n} \right| \to 1$ (and hence $\left| \sfrac{1}{\overline{z_n}} \right| \to 1$, where 
    $\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_n}} \in \closeD$). By continuity of $f$ on $\closeD$, we therefore have

    $$
    \lim_{\left| z_n \right| \to 1} \left| \frac{1}{\overline{f}(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_n}})} \right|
    = \lim_{\left| z_n \right| \to 1} \left| \frac{1}{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z_n}})} \right|
    = \left| \frac{1}{1} \right|
    = 1.
    $$

    and hence $f(z)$ and $1 / \overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z}})}$ agree on the boundary of $\closeD$. Since 
    $\{z_n\}$ was an arbitrary sequence in $\mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$, we conclude that $\tilde{f}$ is continuous
    on all of $\mathbb{C}$. 
    
    By definition, $\tilde{f}$ is holomorphic on the open disc $\mathbb{D}$. It remains to show that $\tilde{f}$ is 
    holomorphic on the boundary of the disc and on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$. We proceed with the latter. Since $f$ 
    is non-vanishing, we have that $\frac{1}{f(\sfrac{1}{z})}$ is holomorphic as a composition of holomorphic functions 
    whenever $|z| > 1$ and therefore has a power series expansion $\sum a_n (z - z_0)^n$ about any 
    $z_0 \in \mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$. Hence for any 
    $\overline{z}, \overline{z_0} \in \mathbb{C} \setminus{\closeD}$, we have 

    $$
    \frac{1}{\overline{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z}})}}
    = \overline{\left(\frac{1}{f(\sfrac{1}{\overline{z}})} \right)} 
    = \overline{\sum a_n (\overline{z} - \overline{z}_0)^n}
    = \left( \sum \overline{a_n} \cdot \overline{(\overline{z} - \overline{z_0})^n} \right)
    = \sum \overline{a_n} (z - z_0)^n
    $$

    so that $\tilde{f}$ is holomorphic in $\mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$ by virtue of the existence of power series 
    expansion about any point in $\mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$. To show that $\tilde{f}$ is entire, we consider a 
    an arbitrary simple closed Jordan curve $\gamma$ which intersects the circle $|z| = 1$ (any such curve which does 
    not intersect this circle integrates to zero by holomorphicity of $\tilde{f}$ away from this circle). By splitting 
    the curve where it intersects the circle by some arbitrary distance $\epsilon > 0$ (see Figure \ref{fig:problem_12}
    ), we obtain two curves $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ which are entirely contained in $\closeD$ and 
    $\mathbb{C} \setminus \closeD$, respectively. Since $\tilde{f}$ is holomorphic in these regions, the integral of 
    $\tilde{f}$ over each curve is zero.  Since this is true for every $\epsilon > 0$, we let $\epsilon \to 0$ and 
    conclude by continuity of $\tilde{f}$ over all $\mathbb{C}$ that the integral of $\tilde{f}$ over $\gamma$ is also 
    zero. Since $\gamma$ was an arbitrary simple closed Jordan curve, we have by Morera's Theorem that $\tilde{f}$ is 
    holomorphic on $|z| = 1$ and is therefore entire. Since $f$ is a continuous function on the compact disc $\closeD$, 
    it (and therefore its conjugate reciprocal) is bounded. By Liouville's Theorem, we have that $\tilde{f}$ is constant 
    as was desired.
