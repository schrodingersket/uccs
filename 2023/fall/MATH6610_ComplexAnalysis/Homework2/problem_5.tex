\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 2.5}

Suppose $f$ is continuously \textit{complex} differentiable on $\Omega$, and $T \subset \Omega$ is a triangle whose 
interior is also contained in $\Omega$. Apply Green's Theorem to show that

$$
\int_T f(z) \; dz = 0.
$$

\textbf{Theorem (Green)}

If $(F, G)$ is a continuously differentiable vector field, then

$$
\int_{T} F \; dx + \int_{T} G \; dy = \int_{T_{int}} \left(G_x - F_y\right) \; dx dy.
$$

\begin{solution}
    Since $f$ is continuously complex differentiable on $\Omega$, the partial derivatives $u_x$, $u_y$, $v_x$, and $v_y$
    of $f = u + iv$ all exist and are continuous. Moreover, they also satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Letting 
    $z = x + iy$ (and hence $dz = dx + i dy$), we have

    \begin{align*}
        \int_T f(z) \; dz = \int_T (u + iv)(dx + i dy) = \int_T (u + iv) \; dx  + \int_T (i u - v) \; dy
    \end{align*}

    Applying Green's Theorem with $F = u + iv$ and $G = iu - v$ yields

    \begin{align*}
        \int_T (u + iv) \; dx  + \int_T (i u - v) \; dy &= \int_{T_{int}} ( i u_x - v_x) - (u_y + iv_y) \; dx dy \\
                                                        &= \int_{T_{int}} (- v_x - u_y) + i(u_x - v_y) \; dx dy \\
                                                        &= \int_{T_{int}} (- v_x + v_x) + i(u_x - u_x) \; dx dy \\
                                                        &= 0
    \end{align*}

    where we have used the fact that $-u_y = v_x$ and $v_y = u_x$ by the Cauchy Riemann equations.
