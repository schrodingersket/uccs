Deduce from this result, and from Exercise 11, the Poisson integral representation forumula from the Cauchy integral 
formula: If $u$ is harmonic in the unit disc and continuous on its closure, then if $z = re^{i \theta}$, we have

$$
u(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} P_r (\theta - \varphi) u(e^{i \varphi}) \; d\varphi
$$

where $P_r(\gamma)$ is the Poisson kernel for the unit disc and is given by

$$
P_r(\gamma) = \frac{1 - r^2}{1 - 2r \cos \gamma + r^2}.
$$
