$\text{Re}(f)$ is constant.

\begin{solution}
    If $\text{Re}(f)$ is constant, then we have by definition that $u(x, y)$ is also constant (where $f = u + iv$) so 
    that $u_x = u_y = 0$. Since $f$ is holomorphic, the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied and hence 
    $v_x = v_y = 0$ so that $v(x, y)$ is also constant. Moreover, $u + i v$ is constant, and so $f = u + iv$ is 
    constant, as desired.
