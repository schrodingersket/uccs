$ \left| z \right| = \text{Re}(z) + 1 $

\begin{solution}
    We let $z = x + i y$ with $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ so that $\left| z \right| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and 
    $\text{Re}(z) = x$. Squaring both sides of the above equation yields

    $$
    x^2 + y^2 = (x + 1)^2
    $$

    so that our equation holds whenever

    $$
    y^2 = 2 x + 1.
    $$

    Since $y$ and $x$ are real, the points $z \in \mathbb{C}$ which satisfy $|z| = \text{Re}(z) + 1$ are precisely those
    which lie on the sideways half-parabola $y^2 = 2 x + 1$ (where $x \ge -\frac{1}{2}$).
