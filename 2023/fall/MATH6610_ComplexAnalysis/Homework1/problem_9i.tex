The series $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}{n z^n}$ does not converge at any point on the unit circle.

\begin{solution}
    Let $|z| = 1$. Then we have

    $$
    |n z^n| = |n| \cdot |z^n| = n \cdot |z|^n = n \cdot 1^n = n > 0.
    $$

    Since the individual terms of the series do not converge to $0$, the series cannot converge when $|z| = 1$.
