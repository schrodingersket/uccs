$ \left| z - z_1 \right| = \left| z - z_2 \right|, \; z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb{C} $

\begin{solution}
    The left-hand side of the equation represents the distance from any point $z$ in the complex plane to $z_1$, and the
    right-hand side represents the distance from that same $z$ to $z_2$. Hence the set of points $z$ in the complex 
    plane which satisfy the above equality is precisely the set of points which are equidistant from both $z_1$ and 
    $z_2$. When $z_1 = z_2$, this corresponds to the entire complex plane. When $z_1 \neq z_2$, this corresponds to a 
    line segment Geometrically, this is a line segment which is perpendicular the line segment connecting $z_1$ and 
    $z_2$ and which passes through the midpoint of the same line.
