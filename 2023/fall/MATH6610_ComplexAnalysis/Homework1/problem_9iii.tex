The series $\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{z^n}{n}}$ converges at every point of the unit circle except $z = 1$.

\begin{solution}
    When $z = 1$, the series becomes the harmonic series, which diverges. When $z \neq 1$ (but $|z| = 1$, so that 
    $z = e^{2 \pi i t}$ for $t \in (0, 1)$), we observe that the sequence of partial sums $\{s_n\}$ is bounded:

    $$
    |s_n| = \left| \sum\limits_{k=0}^n z^k \right|
          = \left| \frac{1 - z^{n+1}}{1 - z} \right|
          = \left| \frac{1 - e^{2 (n+1) \pi i t}}{1 - e^{2 \pi i t}} \right|
          \le \left| \frac{2}{1 - e^{2 \pi i t}} \right|
          = M.
    $$

    Moreover, the sequence $\{a_n\}$ defined by $a_n = \frac{1}{n}$ is a positive decreasing sequence which converges to 
    zero. Hence by the Dirichlet test, the series converges at every point on the unit circle except $z = 1$.
