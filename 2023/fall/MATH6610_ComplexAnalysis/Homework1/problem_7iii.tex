$|f|$ is constant.

\begin{solution}
    Since $f$ is holomorphic, the partial derivatives of $u$ and $v$ exist and are continuous. Since $|f|$ is constant,
    $|f|^2 = u^2 + v^2$ is also constant. We differentiate both sides with respect to $x$ and apply the Cauchy-Riemann 
    equations to find:

    $$
    0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}(u^2 + v^2) = 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + 2v\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} = 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - 2v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}
    $$

    and similarly for $y$:

    $$
    0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}(u^2 + v^2) = 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + 2v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 2u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + 2v\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
    $$

    so that (after dividing by a factor of two) we have

    $$
    \begin{pmatrix*}
        u & -v \\
        v & u
    \end{pmatrix*} \begin{pmatrix*}
        u_x \\
        u_y
    \end{pmatrix*} = \begin{pmatrix*}
        0 \\
        0
    \end{pmatrix*}.
    $$

    We note that the determinant of this matrix is $u^2 + v^2 = |f|^2 = C$ for some constant $C$. If $C = 0$, then 
    $|f| = 0$ and $f$ vanishes identically (by positive definiteness of the modulus) on $\Omega$ and is therefore 
    constant. Conversely, if $C \neq 0$ then the matrix is invertible and hence its null space is trivial. Hence 
    $u_x = u_y = 0$ and $u$ is therefore constant. By (a), $f$ must also be constant.
