\textbf{Lang 8.4.4}

Let $\{u_n\}$ be a sequence of harmonic functions on the open disc $D_{\rho}$ where $\rho$ is the radius of the disc. 
Prove that if $\{u_n\}$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of the disc, then the limit is harmonic.

\begin{solution}
  Since $u_n$ is harmonic on $D_{\rho}$, we may write $u_n = \text{Re}(f_n)$ for some holomorphic function $f_n$ on 
  $D_{\rho}$. Since each $f_n$ is unique up to an imaginary constant, we construct a new sequence of holomorphic 
  functions $\{g_n\}$ by subtracting off this imaginary constant $i K_n$ from each $f_n$ so that $g_n = f_n - i K_n$ for 
  each $n$. We now let $K$ be a compact subset of $D_{\rho}$ and fix $\epsilon > $ and $0 < r < R < \rho$ such that $K$ 
  is contained in $D_R = D(0, R)$. Since each $g_n$ is holomorphic on $\overline{D}_R$, we may apply Theorem 8.4.2 from 
  \textit{Lang} to obtain

  $$
  g_n(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \text{Re} \left(g_n(R e^{i \theta})\right) P_{R, r}(\theta - \phi) \, d\theta
         = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} u_n(R e^{i \theta}) P_{R, r}(\theta - \phi) \, d\theta
  $$

  for every $z \in D_R$. Let $u$ be the uniform limit of $\{u_n\}$ on $\overline{D}_R$. We define

  $$
  g(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} u(R e^{i \theta}) P_{R, r}(\theta - \phi) \, d\theta
  $$

  and observe that 

  \begin{align*}
  |g(z) - g_n(z)| &= \left| \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \left(u_n(R e^{i \theta}) - u(R e^{i \theta})\right) P_{R, r}(\theta - \phi) \, d\theta  \right| \\
                  &\le \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \left|u_n(R e^{i \theta}) - u(R e^{i \theta})\right| P_{R, r}(\theta - \phi) \, d\theta \\
                  &\le \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \left|u_n(R e^{i \theta}) - u(R e^{i \theta})\right| \frac{1}{2 \pi}\frac{R + r}{R - r} \, d\theta
  \end{align*}

  where we have applied Exercise 8.4.2 from \textit{Lang} to obtain the last inequality. In particular, since 
  $\overline{D}_R$ is compact, there exists some $N_{D_R} \in \mathbb{N}$ so that 
  $|u_n(z) - u(z)| < 2 \pi \epsilon \frac{R - r}{R + r}$ for all $n \ge N_{D_R}$ and all $z \in C_R$. We therefore 
  conclude

  $$
  |g(z) - g_n(z)| \le \frac{1}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \left|u_n(R e^{i \theta}) - u(R e^{i \theta})\right| \frac{1}{2 \pi}\frac{R + r}{R - r} \, d\theta \\
                  < \frac{\epsilon}{2 \pi}\int_0^{2 \pi} \, d\theta \\
                  = \epsilon,
  $$

  for all $z \in D_R$ whenever $n > N_{D_R}$. Hence $g_n$ converges uniformly to $g$ on $D_R$ (and therefore also $K$). 
  Moreover, $g$ is the uniform limit of holomorphic functions and is therefore itself holomorphic on $K$ so that its 
  real part is harmonic. Lastly, we note that

  $$
  u = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} u_n = \lim\limits_{n \to \infty} \text{Re}(g_n) = \text{Re}(g)
  $$

  and hence $u$ is harmonic on $K$. Since $K$ was chosen to be arbitrary, we conclude the limit of $\{u_n\}$ is itself
  harmonic (since for any $z \in D_{\rho}$, we may construct a compact set $K \subset D_{\rho}$ which contains $z$), 
  as was to be shown.
