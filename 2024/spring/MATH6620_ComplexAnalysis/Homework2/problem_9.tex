\textbf{Lang 10.1.1}

Let $U$ be a simply connected open set, and let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be two points in $U$. Prove that there exists a 
holomorphic automorphism $f$ of $U$ such that $f(z_1) = z_2$. (Distinguish the cases when $U = \mathbb{C}$ and 
$U \neq \mathbb{C}$).

\begin{solution}
  Suppose first that $U = \mathbb{C}$. Then the function $f(z) = z + z_2 - z_1$ is a translation of the entire complex 
  plane and is therefore a holomorphic automorphism of $U = \mathbb{C}$ which maps $z_1$ to $z_2$ (with holomorphic 
  inverse $f^{-1}(w) = w - z_2 + z_1$). Now suppose that $U \neq \mathbb{C}$. Since $U$ is simply connected, we may
  apply the Riemann Mapping Theorem to $U$ to obtain a unique holomorphic automorphism $F_1: U \to \mathbb{D}$ (resp. 
  $F_2: U \to \mathbb{D}$) which maps $z_1$ (resp. $z_2$) to zero. Since compositions of conformal maps are themselves
  conformal, we conclude that the composition $f: U \to U$ defined by

  $$
  f(z) = F_1 \circ F_2^{-1} (z)
  $$
   
  is a holomorphic automorphism of $U$ which maps $z_1$ to $z_2$, as desired.
