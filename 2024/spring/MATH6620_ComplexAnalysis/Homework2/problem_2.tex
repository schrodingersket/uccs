Prove that the function $u$ defined by

$$
u(x, y) = \text{Re} \left( \frac{i + z}{i - z} \right) \quad \text{and} \quad u(0, 1) = 0
$$

is harmonic in the unit disc and vanishes on its boundary. Note also that $u$ is not bounded in $\mathbb{D}$.

\begin{solution}
  We begin with the observation that $f(z) = \frac{i + z}{i - z}$ is holomorphic in $\mathbb{D}$ since it is the 
  quotient of two holomorphic functions and $i \notin \mathbb{D}$. Since the real and imaginary parts of a holomorphic 
  function are harmonic, we conclude that $u = \text{Re} \left( \frac{i + z}{i - z} \right)$ must be harmonic in 
  $\mathbb{D}$.

  To show that $u$ vanishes on the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$, we let $z = r \argz$ to obtain the following expression for 
  $f$:

  $$
  f(r, \theta) = \frac{i + r \argz}{i - r \argz} \cdot \frac{-i - r \argz[-]}{-i - r \argz[-]} 
               = \frac{1 - ir\left(\argz + \argz[-]\right) - r^2}{1 + ir \left(\argz - \argz[-] \right) + r^2}
               = \frac{1 - 2ir \cos{\theta} - r^2}{1 - 2r \sin{\theta} + r^2}.
  $$

  so that

  $$
  u(r, \theta) = \text{Re} (f) = \frac{1 - r^2}{1 - 2r \sin{\theta} + r^2}.
  $$

  In particular, we observe that $r = 1$ and $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$ when $x = 0$ and $y = 1$, so that in polar 
  coordinates we have $u\left(1, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0$. Moreover, for any fixed $\theta \in [0, 2 \pi) \setminus \left\{ \frac{\pi}{2} \right\}$, we have

  $$
  \lim_{|z| \to 1} \text{Re} \left(\frac{z + i}{z - i}\right) = \lim_{r \to 1} u(r, \theta) 
                                                              = \lim_{r \to 1} \frac{1 - r^2}{1 - 2r \sin{\theta} + r^2} 
                                                              = \frac{1 - (1)^2}{2(1 - \sin{\theta})} 
                                                              = 0,
  $$

  from which we conclude that $u$ vanishes on the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$, as desired.
