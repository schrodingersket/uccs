Let $\{f_n\}$ be a uniformly bounded sequence of analytic functions on $U$, and assume that for each $z \in U$, the 
sequence $\{f_n(z)\}$ converges. Show that $\{f_n\}$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $U$.

\begin{solution}
  Let $\mathcal{F} = \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\{f_n\}$ denote the family of functions whose elements are elements of 
  the sequence $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$. Since each $f_n$ is holomorphic on $U$, $f_n$ is also holomorphic on every 
  compact subset of $U$; moreover, since $\{f_n\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is uniformly bounded on $U$, it is therefore also 
  uniformly bounded on every compact subset of $U$. We may therefore apply Montel's theorem to conclude that 
  $\mathcal{F}$ is a normal family of functions and is equicontinuous on every compact subset of $U$.

  Let $K$ be a compact subset of $U$, and let $\epsilon > 0$. We show that $\{f_n\}$ is uniformly Cauchy on $K$. 
  Firstly, since $\mathcal{F}$ is equicontinuous on $K$, there exists some $\delta$ such that 
  $|f_n(z) - f_n(w)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $z, w \in K$ whenever 
  $|z - w| < \delta$. From this, we cover $K$ with open balls of radius $\delta$ centered at each $z_0 \in K$ so that 
  within each ball we have $|f_n(z) - f_n(w)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every 
  $z, w \in B_{\delta}(z_0)$. Since $K$ is compact, there exists a finite subcover of $K$, which we denote by

  $$
    \bigcup\limits_{j = 1}^{N} B_{\delta}(z_j).
  $$

  By virtue of the fact that this set is a covering of $K$, we note that for every $z \in K$, there exists some 
  $1 \le i \le N$ such that such that $|z - z_i| < \delta$ and hence

  $$
    |f_n(z) - f_m(z)| \le |f_n(z) - f_n(z_i)| + |f_n(z_i) - f_m(z_i)| + |f_m(z_i) - f_m(z)| 
                      < \frac{2 \epsilon}{3} + |f_n(z_i) - f_m(z_i)|.
  $$

  Furthermore, since $\{f_n(z)\}$ converges pointwise in $U$, we observe that for each fixed $z \in K$, the sequence 
  $\{f_n(z)\}$ is Cauchy. Therefore, for each $z_j$ from our finite subcover, there exists some $M_j \in \mathbb{N}$ 
  such that $|f_n(z_j) - f_m(z_j)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3}$ for all $n, m \ge M_j$. Letting 
  $M = \max\limits_{1 \le j \le N}{M_j}$, we conclude that

  $$
    |f_n(z_j) - f_m(z_j)| < \frac{\epsilon}{3} \quad \text{for all } 1 \le j \le N
  $$

  whenever $n, m > M$. Combining this result with our earlier inequality yields

  $$
    |f_n(z) - f_m(z)| < \frac{2 \epsilon}{3} + |f_n(z_i) - f_m(z_i)| < \epsilon,
  $$

  whenever $n, m > M$. Since this holds for every $z \in K$, we conclude that $f_n$ is uniformly Cauchy on the 
  arbitrarily-chosen $K$ and so $f_n$ converges uniformly on compact subsets of $U$.
