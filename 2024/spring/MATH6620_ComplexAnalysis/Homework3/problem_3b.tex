Let $\{a_k\}_{k = 0}^{\infty}$ be a sequence of distinct complex numbers such that $a_0 = 0$ and 
$\lim_{k \to \infty} |a_k| = \infty$, and let $E(z)$ denote a Weierstrass product associated with $\{a_k\}$. Given 
complex numbers $\{b_k\}_{k = 0}^{\infty}$, show that there exists integers $m_k \ge 1$ such that the series

$$
F(z) = \frac{b_0}{E'(z)} \frac{E(z)}{z} + \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{b_k}{E'(a_k)} \frac{E(z)}{z - a_k} \left(\frac{z}{a_k} \right)^{m_k}
$$

defines an entire function that satisfies $F(a_k) = b_k$ for all $k \ge 0$. This result is known as the Pringsheim 
interpolation formula.
