Prove that for $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \{1\}$, the function

$$
f(z) = \int_0^z \frac{d\zeta}{\sqrt{\zeta (\zeta - 1)(\zeta - \lambda)}}
$$

is a conformal map from the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ to a rectangle such that one of the rectangle's vertices is 
the image of the point at infinity.
