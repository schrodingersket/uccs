\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 8.22}

Prove that if $P$ is a simply connected region bounded by a polygon with vertices $a_1, \dots, a_n$ and angles 
$\alpha_1 \pi, \dots, \alpha_n \pi$, and $F$ is a conformal map of the disc $\mathbb{D}$ to $P$, then there exist 
complex numbers $B_1, \dots, B_n$ on the unit circle along with constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that

$$
F(z) = c_1 \int_1^z \frac{d\zeta}{(\zeta - B_1)^{\beta_1} \cdots (\zeta - B_n)^{\beta_n}} + c_2.
$$

\textit{Hint: } This follows from the standard correspondence between $\mathbb{H}$ and $\mathbb{D}$ with an argument 
similar to the one found in the proof of Theorem 4.7. See also Theorem 4.6.
