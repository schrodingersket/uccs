\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 8.1}

A holomorphic mapping $f: U \to V$ is a \textbf{local bijection} on $U$ if for every $z \in U$ there exists an open disc
$D \subset U$ centered at $z$ such that $f: D \to f(D)$ is a bijection.

Prove that a holomorphic map $f : U \to V$ is a local bijection if and only if $f'(x) \neq 0$ for all $z \in U$.

\textit{Hint:} Use Rouche's theorem as in the proof of Proposition 1.1.
