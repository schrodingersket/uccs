Suppose $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and $(y_1, y_2, y_3)$ are two pairs of three distinct points on the real axis such that

$$
x_1 < x_2 < x_3 \quad \text{and} \quad y_1 < y_2 < y_3.
$$

Prove that there exists a unique automorphism $\Phi : \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{H}$ of $\mathbb{H}$ such that 
$\Phi(x_j) = y_j$ for $j = 1, 2, 3$ and that the same conclusion holds if $y_3 < y_1 < y_2$ or $y_2 < y_3 < y_1$.
