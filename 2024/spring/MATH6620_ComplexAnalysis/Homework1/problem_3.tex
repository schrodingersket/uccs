\textbf{Stein, Shakarchi 8.5}

Prove that the mapping defined by

$$
f(z) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)
$$

is a conformal map from the half-disc $\mathbb{S} = \{z = x + iy \mid |z| < 1, y > 0\}$ onto the upper half-plane 
$\mathbb{H} = \{z = x + iy \mid y > 0\}$.

\textit{Hint:} The equation $f(z) = w$ reduces to the quadratic equation $z^2 + 2wx + 1 = 0$, which has two distinc 
roots in $\mathbb{C}$ whenever $w \neq \pm 1$ (which is certainly the case for $w \in \mathbb{H}$).
