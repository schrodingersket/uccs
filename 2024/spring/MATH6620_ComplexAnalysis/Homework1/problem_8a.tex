Suppose $\Phi: \mathbb{H} \to \mathbb{H}$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{H}$ that fixes three distinct points on the 
real axis. Then $\Phi$ is the identity.


\begin{solution}
  Since $\Phi$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{H}$, it must take the form

  $$
  \Phi(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d},
  $$

  for some $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$ where $ad - bc = 1$. For any real fixed point $x_i \in \mathbb{R}$ of $\Phi$, the 
  above statement implies that 

  $$
  \Phi(x_i) = \frac{ax_i + b}{cx_i + d} = x_i.
  $$

  We suppose that $\Phi$ fixes three distinct points $x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \mathbb{R}$ so that 
  $cx_i^2 + (d - a)x_i - b = 0$ for each $i = 1, 2, 3$. Rearranging this into a system of equations yields

  $$
  \begin{pmatrix}
  1 & x_1 & x_1^2 \\
  1 & x_2 & x_2^2 \\
  1 & x_3 & x_3^2
  \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
    -b \\
    d - a \\
    c
  \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
    0 \\
    0 \\
    0
  \end{pmatrix}.
  $$

  The matrix on the left-hand side of the equation is a Vandermonde matrix, which we denote $V$; it is well-known that 
  the determinant of such a matrix is given by

  $$
  \det(V) = \prod_{1 \le i < j \le 3} (x_j - x_i) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_2 - x_3)(x_1 - x_3) \neq 0,
  $$

  since $x_1, x_2, x_3$ are distinct. Since $\det(V) \neq 0$, the matrix $V$ is invertible and hence the only solution 
  to the above system is

  $$
  c = b = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad d = a.
  $$

  Substituting these values into our original $\Phi(z)$ yields

  $$
  \Phi(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d} = \frac{az}{az} = z
  $$

  for all $z \in \mathbb{C}$ and therefore $\Phi$ is the identity, as was to be shown.
