Suppose $U$ and $V$ are conformally equivalent. Prove that if $U$ is simply connected, then so is $V$.

Note that this conclusion remains valid if we merely assume that there exists a continuous bijection between $U$ and 
$V$.

\begin{solution}
  % Recall that if $U$ is a simply connected region, then any two pair of curves in $U$ with the same endpoints are 
  % homotopic, i.e., if $\gamma_0, \gamma_1$ are two curves in $U$ with common endpoints and are parametrized on $[a, b]$
  % such that
 
  % $$
  % \gamma_0(a) = \gamma_1(a) \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma_0(b) = \gamma_1(b),
  % $$

  % then for each $0 \le s \le 1$, there exists a curve $\gamma_s \in U$ parametrized by $\gamma_s(t)$ on $[a, b]$ such 
  % that for every $s$,

  % $$
  % \gamma_s(a) = \gamma_0(a) \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma_s(b) = \gamma_0(b),
  % $$

  % and for all $t \in [a, b]$:

  % $$
  % \gamma_s(t)\big\vert_{s=0} = \gamma_0(t) \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma_s(t)\big\vert_{s=1} = \gamma_1(t).
  % $$

  % where $\gamma_s$ is jointly continuous in $s$ and $t$.
 
  
  Let $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ be two curves in $V$ with common endpoints and parametrized on $[a, b]$ such that

  $$
  \gamma_0(a) = \gamma_1(a) \quad \text{and} \quad \gamma_0(b) = \gamma_1(b),
  $$

  Since $U$ and $V$ are conformally equivalent, there exists a continuous bijection $f: U \to V$ whose inverse is 
  holomorphic and therefore continuous (in other words, $f$ is a homeomorphism). In particular, since $\gamma_0$ and 
  $\gamma_1$ are continuous in their parametrized domain, then $f^{-1} \circ \gamma_0$ and $f^{-1} \circ \gamma_1$ are 
  also continuous curves in $U$ with common endpoints since $f^{-1} \circ \gamma_0(a) = f^{-1} \circ \gamma_1(a)$ 
  (resp. $b$). By virtue of the fact that $U$ is simply connected, there exists a homotopy $\gamma'_s$ between 
  $f^{-1} \circ \gamma_0$ and $f^{-1} \circ \gamma_1$ in $U$ (so that $\gamma'_0 = f^{-1} \circ \gamma_0$ and 
  $\gamma'_1 = f^{-1} \circ \gamma_1$). Since $f$ is a homeomorphism, $f \circ \gamma'_s$ defines a function in $V$ 
  which is jointly continuous in $s$ and $t$. In particular, for $s = 0$ (resp. $s = 1$), we have
 
  $$
  f \circ \gamma'_0(t) = f \circ f^{-1} \circ \gamma_0(t) = \gamma_0(t)
  $$
  
  
  so that $\gamma'_s$ satisfies the conditions of a homotopy between $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$. Since $\gamma_0$ and 
  $\gamma_1$ were chosen to be arbitrary, we conclude that $V$ is simply connected.
