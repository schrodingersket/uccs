Prove that the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ is simply connected.

\begin{solution}
  Let $z_1, z_2 \in \mathbb{D}$. Then the line segment $\gamma: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{D}$ defined by
  $\gamma(s) = (1 - s) z_1 + s z_2$ defines a path from $z_1$ to $z_2$ which is contained in $\mathbb{D}$, since
  for each $s \in [0, 1]$, we have:\footnote{
    In particular, this shows that the unit disc is convex.
  }

  $$
  |\gamma(s)| = |(1 - s) z_1 + s z_2| \leq |(1 - s) z_1| + |s z_2| = (1 - s)|z_1| + s |z_2| < (1 - s) + s = 1.
  $$
 
  Let $\gamma_1, \gamma_2: [0, 1] \to \mathbb{D}$ be two paths from $z_1$ to $z_2$ which share the same endpoints and
  are parametrized by $t \in [0, 1]$. Consider the function

  $$
  \psi(s, t) = \gamma_s(t) = (1 - s)\gamma_1(t) + s \gamma_2(t)
  $$

  which is continuous in $s$ and $t$ (by virtue of continuity in $t$ of $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ as paths). In 
  particular, for $s = 0$ we have

  $$
  \psi(0, t) = (1 - 0) \gamma_1(t) + 0 \cdot \gamma_2(t) = \gamma_1(t),
  $$

  and for $s = 1$, we have
 
  $$
  \psi(1, t) = (1 - 1)\gamma_1(t) + 1 \cdot \gamma_2(t) = \gamma_2(t).
  $$

  Moreover, for every fixed $t \in [0, 1]$, our first inequality shows that $\psi(s, t) \in \mathbb{D}$ (since 
  $\gamma_1(t), \gamma_2(t) \in \mathbb{D}$ for every $t \in [0, 1]$), so that $\psi$ defines a homotopy between 
  $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$. Since $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ were chosen to be arbitrary, there exists a homotopy
  $\psi$ between any two curves in $\mathbb{D}$ and we may therefore conclude that $\mathbb{D}$ is simply connected.
