\textbf{LeVeque 2.4} 

a) Modify the m-file \texttt{bvp2.m} so that it implements a Dirichlet boundary condition at $x = a$ and a Neumann
   condition at $x = b$ and test the modified program.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
   See \texttt{problem\_4a.m}; differences between \texttt{problem\_4a.m} and source \texttt{bvp2.m} file can be found
   in \texttt{problem\_4a.diff}.
\end{solution}

b) Make the same modification to the m-file \texttt{bvp4.m}, which implements a fourth order accurate method. Again test
   the modified program.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
   See \texttt{problem\_4b.m}; differences between \texttt{problem\_4b.m} and source \texttt{bvp4.m} file can be found
   in \texttt{problem\_4b.diff}.
\end{solution}
