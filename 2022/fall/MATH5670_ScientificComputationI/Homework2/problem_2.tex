\textbf{LeVeque 2.2} 

a) Determine the Green's functions for the two-point boundary value problem $u''(x) = f(x)$ on $0 < x < 1$ with a 
   Nuemann boundary condition at $x = 0$ and a Dirichlet condition at $x = 1$, i.e., find the function $G(x, \bar{x})$
   which solves

    $$
        u''(x) = \delta(x - \bar{x}),\; u'(0) = 0,\; u(1) = 0
    $$

   and the functions $G_0(x)$ solving

    $$
        u''(x) = 0,\; u'(0) = 1,\; u(1) = 0
    $$

   and $G_1(x)$ solving

    $$
        u''(x) = 0,\; u'(0) = 0,\; u(1) = 1.
    $$

b) Using this as guidance, find the general formulas for the elements of the inverse of the matrix in equation (2.54).
   Write out the $5 \times 5$ matrices $A$ and $A^{-1}$ for the case $h = 0.25$.
