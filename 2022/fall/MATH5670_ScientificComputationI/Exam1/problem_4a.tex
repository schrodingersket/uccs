Consider the second-order problem

$$
u''(x) = x u(x),\; x \ge 0
$$

which has a unique solution $u(x)$ when $u$ disappears at infinity. Find this solution numerically, either by solving
it as a boundary value problem or as an initial value problem.

    We plot our computed solution $U(x)$ from \texttt{problem\_4a.m} against the built-in \texttt{airy} function
    (denoted $Ai(x)$) below:
