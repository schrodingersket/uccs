Consider the eigenvalue problem for the 2D Laplacian on the domain $\Omega \in [0, 1] \times [0, 1]$ with Dirichlet
boundary conditions:

$$
\Delta u = \lambda u
$$

Solve for $u$ using the 5-point Laplacian and explain how well the eigenvalues $\lambda_{m,n} = -(m^2 + n^2)\pi^2$ are
approximated. Plot eigenfunctions for the first few eigenvalues.
