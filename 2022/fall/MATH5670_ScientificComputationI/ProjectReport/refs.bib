  abstract = {We introduce physics-informed neural networks – neural networks that are trained to solve supervised learning tasks while respecting any given laws of physics described by general nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we present our developments in the context of solving two main classes of problems: data-driven solution and data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

	abstract = {Long wave propagation above a bottom topography such as tsunami waves can be modeled mathematically by applying shallow water wave equations. The finite volume method was developed to determine the numerical solution of shallow water wave equations. The method uses Lax-Friedrichs scheme for the determination of numerical fluxes at cell interfaces. Furthermore, the model and method was applied to the simulation of long wave propagation on a sloping beach. The simulation results shows that the present model and method has a power of simulation of long wave propagation of the tsunami wave on the beach topography with a slope.},

Results obtained by these ways for some modest values of viscosity have been compared with the exact (Fourier) one. It is shown that they are in good agreement with each other.}
