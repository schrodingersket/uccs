The m-file \texttt{heat\_CN.m} solves the heat equation $u_t = \kappa u_{xx}$ using the Crank-Nicolson method. Run this
code, and by changing the number of grid points, confirm that it is second-order accurate. (Observe how the error at
some fixed time such as $T = 1$ behaves as $k$ and $h$ go to zero with a fixed relation between $k$ and $h$, such as
$k = 4h$.)
