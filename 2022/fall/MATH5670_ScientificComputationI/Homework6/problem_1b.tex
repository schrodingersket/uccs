Suppose we take $k = \alpha h^2$ for some fixed $\alpha > 0$ and refine the grid. For what values of $\alpha$ (if any)
will this method be Lax-Richtmeyer stable (and therefore convergent)?

\textbf{Hint:} Consider the MOL interpretation and the stability region of the time-discretization being used.
