\textbf{LeVeque 3.2} 

a) Show that the 9-point Laplacian (3.17) has the truncation error derived in Section 3.5. \textbf{Hint: } To simplify
   the computation, note that the 9-point Laplacian can be written as the 5-point Laplacian (with known truncation 
   error) plus a finite difference approximation that models $\frac{1}{6} h^2 u_{xxyy} + \mathcal{O}(h^4)$.

b) Modify the \texttt{MATLAB} script \texttt{poisson.m} to use the 9-point Laplacian (3.17) instead of the 5-point
   Laplacian, and to solve the linear system (3.18) where $f_{ij}$ is given by (3.19). Perform a grid refinement study
   to verify that fourth order accuracy is achieved.
