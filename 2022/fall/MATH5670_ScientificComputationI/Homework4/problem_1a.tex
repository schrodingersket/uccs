Run this program for each method and produce a plot similar to Figure 4.2.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    We show the error per iteration for the boundary value problem $u''(x) = f(x)$ for the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, and
    Successive over-relaxation (SOR) methods below: \\\\

    \end{figure}

    As expected, we see that the SOR method converges radically faster than the Jacobi or Gauss-Seidel methods.
