Implement this method in \texttt{iter\_bvp\_Asplit.m} and observe that it converges at the same rate as forward 
Gauss-Seidel for this problem.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    We show the error per iteration for the boundary value problem $u''(x) = f(x)$ for the forward and backward
    Gauss-Seidel matrix splitting methods below: \\\\

    As expected, we see that the forward and backward Gauss-Seidel method converge at the same rate.
