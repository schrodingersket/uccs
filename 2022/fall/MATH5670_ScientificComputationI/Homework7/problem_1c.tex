Show that this method is in fact stable for this range of Courant numbers by doing von Neumann analysis.

\textbf{Hint:} Let $\gamma(\xi) = e^{i \xi h} g(\xi)$ and show that $\gamma$ satisfies a quadratic equation closely
related to the equation (10.34) that arises from a von Neumann analysis of the leapfrog method.
