For what range of Courant number $\frac{ak}{h}$ does this method satisfy the CFL condition?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    To satisfy the CFL condition, we require that the domain of dependence for the skewed leapfrog method encompasses
    that of the advection equation, which has a domain of dependence of $\mathcal{D}(X, T) = \{X - aT\}$. For the 
    solution at $(X, T)$, the skewed leapfrog method at a particular grid point $(x_j, t_n)$ depends on the values 
    at $(x_{j-2}, t_{n-1}), (x_{j-2}, t_n), (x_{j}, t_{n})$ and $(x_{j}, t_{n+1})$. We therefore require that

    \begin{align*}
        |a| &\le \frac{x_{j} - x_{j-2}}{t_{n+1} - t_{n}} \\
            &\le \frac{2h}{k} 
    \end{align*}

    and hence the CFL condition is satisfied precisely when $\nu = \big| \frac{ak}{h} \big| \le 2$.
