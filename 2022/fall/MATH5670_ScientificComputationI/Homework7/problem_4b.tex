Modify \texttt{advection\_lf\_pbc.m} so that the initial data consists of a wave packet

$$
\eta(x) = e^{-\beta (x - 0.5)^2}\sin{(\xi x)}
$$

Work out the true solution $u(x, t)$ for this data. Using $\beta = 100$, $\xi = 80$, and $U_j^1 = u(x_j, k)$, test that
your code still exhibits second order accuracy for $k$ and $h$ sufficiently small.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    We observe approximately second order accuracy with the leapfrog method. The output of \texttt{problem\_4b.m} is
    given below: \ \\\\

         Least squares fit gives E(h) = 10068 * h^2.06832
        \end{verbatim}

    \end{figure}

    Since the least squares fit is given by $E(h) = 10068 h^{2.06832}$, we see this method is roughly second order 
    accurate as desired. The \texttt{loglog} and solution plots for this method are given below:

    % Since the true solution for the advection equation is given by $u(x, t) = \eta(x - at)$, we have:

    % $$
    % u(x, t) = e^{-\beta (x - at - 0.5)^2}\sin{[\xi (x - at)]}
    % $$
