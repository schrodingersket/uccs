Suppose we use the same method for the initial-boundary value problem with $u(0, t) = g_0(t)$ specified. Since the 
method has a one-sided stencil, no numerical boundary condition is needed at the right boundary (i.e., the formula for
our method may be applied at $x_{m+1})$. For what range of $\frac{ak}{h}$ will the CFL condition be satisfied in this
case? What are the eigenvalues of the $A$ matrix for this case and when will the method be stable?
