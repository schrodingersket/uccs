Using $\beta = 100$, $\xi = 150$, and $U_j^1 = u(x_j, k)$, estimate the group velocity of the wave packet computed with
leapfrog using $m = 199$ and $k = 0.4h$. How well does this compare with the value (10.52) predicted by the modified
equation?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    The output of \texttt{problem\_4c.m} is as follows: \ \\\\

    \begin{figure}[h]
        \begin{verbatim}
        Initial wave max is at x=0.52
        at time t = 1.00503e-01  max error =  1.12139e+00
        Final wave max is at x=0.67
        Estimated group velocity is 1.50
        Predicted group velocity is 1.75
        \end{verbatim}
        \caption{Output of \texttt{problem\_4b.m}}
    \end{figure}

    For a high wave number $\xi=150$, we find that the value (10.52) predicted by the modified equation diverges from 
    the estimated velocity by 16\%.
