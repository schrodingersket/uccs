Suppose we want to fix the Courant number $\frac{ak}{h}$ as $k,h \to 0$. For what range of Courant numbers will the
method be stable if $a > 0$? If $a < 0$? Justify your answers in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$ from part 
(a) and the stability region of the trapezoidal method.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    Let $\epsilon = \frac{ah}{2}$. Then we may look at the trapezoidal method for the advection equation as a forward
    Euler discretization of the advection diffusion equation $u_t + au_x = \epsilon u_{xx}$, which yields the system
    of ODEs

    $$
    U'(t) = A_{\epsilon}U(t)
    $$

    where $A_{\epsilon}$ is given by (10.15) in LeVeque. For this method to be stable, we require $k$ to be small
    enough relative to $h$ such that $k \lambda$ lies within the stability region of Euler's method. The eigenvalues
    of $A_{\epsilon}$ are given by (10.16) in LeVeque:

    \begin{align*}
        \mu_p &= -\frac{ia}{h}\sin{(2 \pi p h)} - \frac{2 \epsilon}{h^2}[1 - \cos{(2 \pi p h)}]
    \end{align*}

    In particular, the values $k \mu_p$ lie on an ellipse centered at $-\frac{2k \epsilon}{h^2} = -\frac{ak}{h} = \nu$
    with semi-axes of length $\frac{2k \epsilon}{h^2} = \frac{ak}{h} = \nu$ in the $x$-direction and 
    $\frac{ak}{h} = \nu$ in the $y$-direction. Since stability of the forward Euler method requires this ellipse to 
    lie inside the unit circle centered at -1, this method is stable for $a > 0$ whenever $|\nu| \le 1$. For $a < 0$, 
    the left-most side of the ellipse only intersects the stability region for Euler's method at the origin, and hence
    cannot be stable. Since the trapezoidal method is stable in the left half-plane, and so we expect this method to be
    unstable for $a < 0$.
