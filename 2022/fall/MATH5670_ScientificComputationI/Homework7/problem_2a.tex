This method can be viewed as the trapezoidal method applied to an ODE system $U'(t) = AU(t)$ arising from a method of
lines discretization of the advection equation. What is the matrix $A$ (including boundary conditions)?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    To realize a method of lines discretization, we begin by discretizing the advection equation in space with $m$ 
    interior grid points via a backward Euler scheme so that $x_0 = 0$ and $x_{m+1} = 1$:

    \begin{align*}
    U'_j(t) &= -a \left( \frac{U_j(t) - U_{j-1}(t)}{h} \right) \\
            &= -\frac{a}{h} [U_j(t) - U_{j-1}(t)]
    \end{align*}

    By our periodic boundary conditions, we have that $U_0(t) = U_{m+1}(t)$, and so the above system takes the 
    vectorized form $U'(t) = AU$, where $A$ is the $m + 1 \times m + 1$ matrix given by:

    \[
    A = -\frac{a}{h}\begin{pmatrix} 
         1 &         &        &        & -1 \\
        -1 &       1 &        &        &    \\
           &      -1 &      1 &        &    \\
           &         & \ddots & \ddots &    \\
           &         &        & -1     & 1  \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    \]
