For what range of $\frac{ak}{h}$ will the CFL condition be satisfied for this method (with periodic boundary 
conditions)?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    Since the solution at $(x_j, t_{n+1})$ depends on the solution at $(x_{j-1}, t_{n+1})$, the domain of dependence for
    this implicit method is $(-\infty, \infty)$ and hence the CFL condition is satisfied for all 
    $\frac{ak}{h} \in \mathbb{R}$.
