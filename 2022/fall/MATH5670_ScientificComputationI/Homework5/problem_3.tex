\textbf{LeVeque 5.13} \textit{(Order of accuracy of Runge-Kutta methods)}

Consider the Runge-Kutta methods defined by the tableaux below.  In each case show that the method is third order 
accurate in two different ways: First by checking that the order conditions (5.35), (5.38), and (5.39) are satisfied, 
and then by applying one step of the method to $u' = \lambda u$ and verifying that the Taylor series expansion of 
$e^{k\lambda}$ is recovered to the expected order.
