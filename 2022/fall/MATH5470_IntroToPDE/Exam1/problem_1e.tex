Based on part (d), describe the solution $u(x, t)$ as time increases from a small value to a somewhat large value.
To illustrate your point, sketch the graphs of $u(x, t)$ for various $t$ and some fixed bar length $L_0$.

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    We observe that the temperature of the bar uniformly reduces to that of the steady state solution, where the 
    temperature at the insulated end (which was initially the hottest) takes the longest to cool to that uniform steady 
    state temperature.

\end{solution}
