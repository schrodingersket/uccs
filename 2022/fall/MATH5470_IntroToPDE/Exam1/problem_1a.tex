In physical terms, what do the boundary conditions $u(0, t) = 10$ and $u_x(L, t) = 0$ signify?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    The Dirichlet boundary condition $u(0, t) = 10$ at $x = 0$ corresponds to the left end of the rod being held at a
    constant $10^{\circ}$ (e.g., by immersion in a bath or refrigerator which maintains a constant $10^{\circ}$ 
    temperature).

    The Neumann boundary condition $u_x(L, t) = 0$ indicates that no heat escapes or enters the rod at $x = L$, which 
    may be achieved by perfectly insulating the rod at that end.
