Besides the steady state term, what is the next dominant term as $t$ gets large?

\begin{solution}\ \\\\
    As $t$ gets large, the magnitude of each successive Fourier sine coefficient (of index $n$) in the Fourier series 
    decreases by a factor of approximately $(2n - 1)^2$. The first term therefore dominates with the second providing a
    relatively minor contribution. Numerically, the first four Fourier sine coefficients are given by:

    \begin{align*}
        a_1 &= 2.5465  \\
        a_2 &= -0.2829 \\
        a_3 &= 0.1019  \\
        a_3 &= -0.0520 \\
    \end{align*}

    where we see the results of our above prediction explicitly.
