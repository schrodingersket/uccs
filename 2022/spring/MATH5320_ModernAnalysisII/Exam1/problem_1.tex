Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. 

a) Suppose that $\{x_n\}$ is a sequence in $X$ such that $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{d(x_{2n}, y) = 0}$ and
   $\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}{d(x_{2n + 1}, z) = 0}$ for some points $y, z \in X$. Prove that $\{x_n\}$ converges in 
   $X$ if and only if $y = z$.

b) Suppose a metric space $(X, d)$ has a dense subset $Y$ such that every Cauchy sequence in $Y$ converges to a point
   in $X$. Prove that $(X, d)$ is a complete metric space.
