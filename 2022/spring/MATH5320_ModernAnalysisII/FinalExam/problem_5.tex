Let $f:U \to \mathbb{R}$ be a real-valued function defined on an open subset $U \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, and suppose
that the first partial derivatives of $f$ exist and are uniformly bounded on $U$.

a) Prove that $f$ is continuous on $U$.

b) Let $f:U \to \mathbb{R}$ be defined by 

   $$
   f(x, y) = \begin{cases}
     \frac{xy^2}{x^2 + y^4} &\text{if } (x, y) \neq (0, 0) \\
     0                      &\text{if } (x, y) = (0, 0)
   \end{cases} 
   $$

   Show that the first partial derivatives of $f$ exist but are not bounded in any open neighborhood of $(0, 0)$, and
   that $f$ is not continuous at $(0, 0)$.
