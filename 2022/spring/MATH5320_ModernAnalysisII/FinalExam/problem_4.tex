a) Suppose that $f:[0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f(1) = 1$ and $0 < f(x) < 1$ for all 
   $0 \le x < 1$, and that $\lim\limits_{x \to 1^{-}}{\frac{f(1) - f(x)}{1 - x} = \ell > 1}$. Prove that there
   exists some $c \in (0, 1)$ such that $f(c) = c$. \ \\

   \emph{Hint:} Apply the Intermediate Value Theorem to an appropriate function.

b) Suppose that the function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ is continuous with the property that 
   $\lim\limits_{x \to \infty}{f(x)} = \lim\limits_{x \to -\infty}{f(x)} = 0$. Prove that $f$ is uniformly continuous.
