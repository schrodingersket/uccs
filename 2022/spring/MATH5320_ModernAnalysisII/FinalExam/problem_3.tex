a) Show that the function $f:\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(x) = \sin{(\frac{\cos{x}}{2})}$ is a contraction
   mapping. \ \\

b) Suppose that the function $\gamma:[0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}^3$ is continuous, that $\gamma(0) = (0, 0, 0)$, and that
   $\gamma(1) = (1, 1, 1)$. Show that the curve $\gamma(t)$ intersects the plane $x + y + z = 2$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
