a) Let $\{x_n\}$ be a sequence defined on the interval $[0, 1]$, and suppose that every \newline
   convergent subsequence of $\{x_n\}$ has the same limit $x_0$. Prove that $\lim{x_n} = x_0$.

b) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space where $X = C[0, 1]$ and $d(f, g) = \sup\limits_{x \in [0, 1]}{|f(x) - g(x)}|$. Prove
   that the sequence $\{f_n\}$ defined by $f_n(x) = x^n(1 - x^n)$ is not a convergent sequence in $(X, d)$.
