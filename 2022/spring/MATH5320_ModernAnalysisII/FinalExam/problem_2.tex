a) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Show that the function $\delta(x, y) = \frac{d(x, y)}{1 + d(x, y)}$ is a metric on 
   $X$ and that every subset $E \subset X$ is bounded with respect to the metric $\delta$.

b) Prove that the set $S = \{1\} \cup \{ \frac{n}{n+1} \}_{n=1}^{\infty} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is compact with respect to the
   usual metric $d(x, y) = |x - y|$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$.
