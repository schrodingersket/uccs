In the topology $U$ on $\mathbb{R}$, give an example of an arbitrary intersection of open sets that is nonempty and not 
open.

\ \\
\emph{Claim.} The set $\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-\frac{1}{n}, 1 + \frac{1}{n})}$ is an intersection of open sets 
that is non-empty and not open.

\begin{proof}\ \\\\
    Observe that $\bigcup\limits_{n=1}^{\infty}{(-\frac{1}{n}, 1 + \frac{1}{n})} = [0, 1]$. Because any union of open
    intervals (i.e., open sets in $\mathbb{R}_U$) or finite intersection of open intervals in the usual topology on 
    $\mathbb{R}$ is itself an open interval, the closed interval $[0, 1]$ cannot be an open set in $\mathbb{R}_U$.

\end{proof}
