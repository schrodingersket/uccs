(\#11 in 2.5) Prove that if Card$(A) = n$ for any $n\in \mathbb{N}$, then
Card$(\mathcal{P}(A))=2^n$.

    \begin{proof}\ \\\\
        We proceed by way of induction on $n$. To establish the base case for
        induction (i.e., $n = 1$), suppose $A$ is a set containing a single
        element, $a$. Then since $\emptyset \subset A$, we have that
        $\mathcal{P}(A) = \{\emptyset, \{a\}\}$ and hence 
        Card$\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right) = 2^1$, which establishes our base
        case.

        For our inductive step, we suppose that 
        Card$\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right) = 2^n$ holds for any finite set $A$
        such that Card$(A) = n$, and consider an arbitrary finite set $B$ such
        that Card$(B) = n + 1$. Since $B$ is finite, we may list its elements
        $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^{n+1}$ and observe that 
        $B = \{b_i\}_{i=1}^n \cup \{b_{n+1}\}$. Since there are $n$ elements in
        $\{b_i\}_{i=1}^n$, we have by our inductive hypothesis that
        Card$\left(\mathcal{P}\left(\{b_i\}_{i=1}^n\right)\right) = 2^n$.
        Furthermore, the collection of sets $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathcal{P}(B)$
        which contain
        $b_{n+1}$ is given by $\mathcal{A} = \{E \cup \{b_{n+1}\} | E \in \mathcal{P}\left(\{b_i\}_{i=1}^n\right)\}$.
        Because there are $2^n$ sets in $\mathcal{P}\left(\{b_i\}_{i=1}^n\right)$,
        we conclude that Card$(\mathcal{A}) = 2^n$. Finally, because
        $\mathcal{P}(B)$ is equal to all of the sets of $\mathcal{P}(B)$
        without $\{b_{n+1}\}$ unioned with all of the sets of $\mathcal{P}(B)$
        which contain $\{b_{n+1}\}$ (and these two sets are disjoint), we
        see that:

        \begin{align*}
            \text{Card}\left(\mathcal{P}(B)\right) 
              &= \text{Card}\left(\mathcal{A}\right)
                 + \text{Card}\left(\mathcal{P}\left(\{b_i\}_{i=1}^n\right)\right) \\
              &= 2^n + 2^n \\
              &= 2 \cdot 2^n \\
              &= 2^{n+1}. \\
        \end{align*}

        Hence by the Principle of Mathematical Induction, if Card$(A) = n$ for
        any $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then Card$\left(\mathcal{P}(A)\right) = 2^n$.
