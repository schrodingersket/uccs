(\#3 in 2.1) Consider the subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by
$D=\{(x,y)|x\leq y^2\}$. Is this set a Cartesian product of two subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$? Explain.

\emph{Claim.} The subset $D$ of $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by
$D=\{(x,y)|x\leq y^2\}$ is \emph{not} a Cartesian product of two subsets of
$\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{proof}\ \\\\
    Observe that $\{(9, 3), (2, 2)\} \subseteq D$, and suppose that there exist
    some subsets $A, B$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $a \times b = d$. Then 
    $9 \in A$ and $2 \in B$, and so by definition of the Cartesian product, 
    we have that $(9, 2) \in A \times B$. However, $(9, 2) \notin D$ since
    $9 > 2^2 = 4$, which contradicts our assumption that $A \times B = D$. Hence
    there exist no subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $A \times B = D$. \\
