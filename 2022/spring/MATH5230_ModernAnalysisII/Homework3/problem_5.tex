Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and let $Y$ be a subspace of $X$.

a.  Prove that $Z \subseteq Y$ is closed in $Y$ if and only if there exists a closed subset $A \subseteq X$ such that 
    $Z = A \cap Y$. 

\begin{proof}\ \\\\
    Suppose first that $A$ is closed in $X$ and that $Z = A \cap Y$. To show that $Z$ is closed in $Y$, we first show
    that $Y \setminus Z$ can be written as the intersection of the subspace $Y$ and a set which is open in $X$; from
    this, we will deduce that $Y \setminus Z$ is open in $Y$ and hence that $Z$ is closed in $Y$.
    \ \\
    
    We first observe that the fact that $Z = A \cap Y$ yields the following:
    \begin{align*}
        Y \setminus Z &= Y \setminus (A \cap Y) \\
                      &= (Y \setminus A) \cup (Y \setminus Y) \\
                      &= Y \setminus A.
    \end{align*}

    Hence $Y \setminus Z = Y \setminus A$. Furthermore, because $Y$ is contained in $X$, we have the following: 
    \begin{align*}
        Y \cap (X \setminus A) &= Y \cap (Y \setminus A) \\
                               &= Y \setminus A.
    \end{align*}

    We therefore see that $Y \setminus Z = Y \setminus A = Y \cap (X \setminus A)$; because $X \setminus A$ is open in 
    $X$ (since $A$ is closed in $X$), $Y \setminus Z$ may be written as the intersection of $Y$ and a set which is open
    in $X$. $Y \setminus Z$ is therefore open in $Y$, and so $Z$ is closed in $Y$, as desired.

    \ \\
    Suppose conversely that $Z$ is closed in $Y$. Then $Y \setminus Z$ is open in $Y$, and since $Y$ is a subspace of 
    $X$, there exists a set $B$ which is open in $X$ such that $Y \setminus Z = B \cap Y$. Hence we see that the 
    following equality holds:

    \begin{align*}
        Z &= Y \setminus (Y \setminus Z) \\
          &= Y \setminus (B \cap Y) \\
          &= (Y \setminus B) \cup (Y \setminus Y) \\
          &= Y \setminus B.
    \end{align*}

    Finally, because $Y$ is contained in $X$, we have that $Y \setminus B = Y \cap (X \setminus B)$, and so 
    $Z = Y \cap (X \setminus B)$. Because $X \setminus B$ is closed in $X$, we see that $Z$ may be written as the 
    intersection of the subspace $Y$ and a set which is open in $X$, as desired.

b.  Show that every subset $Z \subseteq Y$ that is closed in $Y$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $Y$ is a closed subset
    of $X$.

c.  Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean metric, let $Y = \{(x, 0) \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset X$ with the
    induced metric, and let $Z = \{(x, 0) \mid 0 < x < 1 \} \subset Y$. Show that $Z$ is an open subset of $Y$ but that
    it is not an open subset of $X$.
