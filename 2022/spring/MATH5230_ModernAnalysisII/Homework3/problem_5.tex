Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and let $Y \subset X$.

a.  Prove that $Z \subseteq Y$ is closed if and only if there exists a closed subset $A \subseteq X$ such that 
    $Z = A \cap Y$.

b.  Show that every subset $Z \subseteq Y$ that is closed in $Y$ is closed in $X$ if and  only if $Y$ is a closed subset
    of $X$.

c.  Let $X = \mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean metric, let $Y = \{(x, 0) \mid x \in \mathbb{R} \} \subset X$ with the
    induced metric, and let $Z = \{(x, 0) \mid 0 < x < 1 \} \subset Y$. Show that $Z$ is an open subset of $Y$ but that
    it is not an open subset of $X$.
