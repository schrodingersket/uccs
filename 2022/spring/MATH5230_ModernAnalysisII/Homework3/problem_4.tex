a.  Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and suppose that $Y \subset X$ is nonempty. Prove that $(Y, d)$ is complete if and
    only if $Y$ is a closed subset of $X$.

b. Suppose that $(X, d)$ and $(Y, d')$ are metric spaces and that $f:X \to Y$ and $g:X \to Y$ are continuous functions.
   Prove that the set $A = \{ x \in X \mid f(x) = g(x)\}$ is closed.
