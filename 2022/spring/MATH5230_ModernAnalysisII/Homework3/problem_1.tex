Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space and $A, B \subseteq X$. 

A point $p \in X$ is called an \emph{exterior point} of $A$ provided there exists an open ball of radius $r > 0$ around
$p$ such that $B_r(p) \subseteq X \setminus A$.

A point $p \in X$ is called a \emph{boundary point} of $A$ provided every open ball of radius $r > 0$ contains both
a point in $A$ and a point in $X \setminus A$. Prove the following: \\

a) Prove the following:

i.  $(A \cap B)^{\circ} = A^{\circ} \cap B^{\circ}$, where $A^{\circ}$ and $B^{\circ}$ denote the interior of $A$ and 
    $B$, respectively. \ \\

\begin{proof}\ \\\\
    Observe that if $A$ or $B$ are empty, then $A \cap B = \emptyset$, $(A \cap B)^\circ = \emptyset$, 
    $A^{\circ} = \emptyset$, $B^{\circ} = \emptyset$, and hence $A^{\circ} \cap B^{\circ} = \emptyset$. We may therefore 
    assume that $A$ and $B$ are non-empty sets.

    Let $x \in (A \cap B)^{\circ}$. Then because $(A \cap B)^{\circ}$ is open, there exists an open ball 
    $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq (A \cap B)^{\circ} \subseteq A \cap B$. Hence $B_\epsilon(x)$ is an open ball which is 
    contained in both $B$ and $A$, and because $A^\circ$ and $B^\circ$ are the largest open sets contained in $A$ and 
    $B$ respectively, we have that $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A^\circ$ and $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq B^\circ$. Thus 
    $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq A^\circ \cap B^\circ$, and so $x \in A^\circ \cap B^\circ$. Since $x$ was chosen to be
    an arbitrary point in $(A \cap B)^{\circ}$, we have that $(A \cap B)^{\circ} \subseteq A^\circ \cap B^\circ$. \\

    Conversely, suppose $x \in A^\circ \cap B^\circ$. Because $A^\circ$ and $B^\circ$ are open, there exist radii 
    $\alpha > 0$ and $\beta > 0$ such that the open balls $B_\alpha(x) \subseteq A^\circ$ and 
    $B_\beta(x) \subseteq B^\circ$ are fully contained in their respective open sets. Let 
    $\epsilon = \min{(\alpha, \beta)}$, and observe that the open ball $B_\epsilon(x)$ is an open set contained in both
    $A$ and $B$, and hence $B_\epsilon(x) \subseteq (A \cap B)^\circ$. Since $x \in B_\epsilon(x)$ by definition, we
    have that $x \in (A \cap B)^\circ$. Because $x$ was chosen to be an arbitrary point in $A^\circ \cap B^\circ$, we
    have that $A^\circ \cap B^\circ \subseteq (A \cap B)^\circ$ and hence 
    $A^\circ \cap B^\circ = (A \cap B)^\circ$, as desired.

v. $A^{\circ} \cup \text{bd}(A) = A \cup A'$ \ \\
    
\begin{proof}\renewcommand{\qedsymbol}{}\ \\\\
    Observe that if $A = \emptyset$, then $A^\circ = bd(A) = A' = \emptyset$ and our claim is trivially true. We may
    therefore assume that $A$ is non-empty.

    Suppose that $x \in A^\circ \cup bd(A)$. Then $x$ is in at least one of $A^\circ$ or $bd(A)$. If $x \in A^\circ$, 
    then $x$ is also in $A$ and hence $x \in A \cup A'$.  Suppose $x \in bd(A)$. If $x \in A$, then $x \in A \cup A'$ 
    trivially, and so we may assume that $x \in X \setminus A$. Then every open ball centered about $x$
    contains a point in $A$ which is different from $x$, and hence $x$ is a limit point of $A$. 
    Hence $x \in A' \subseteq A \cup A'$. Since $x$ was chosen to be arbitrary, we have that 
    $A^\circ \cup bd(A) \subseteq A \cup A'$. \\

    Now suppose that $x \in A \cup A'$. Then $x$ is in at least one of $A$ or $A'$. Suppose $x \in A'$ and furthermore
    that $x \in X \setminus A$. Then because $x$ is a limit point, every open ball centered about $x$ contains a point
    in $A$ which is not $x$. Since $x$ itself is not in $A$, every such open ball contains a point in $A$ and a 
    point not in $A$, and so $x$ is in the boundary of $A$. Conversely, if $x$ is
    a limit point of $A$ which is also in $A$, then either every open ball centered about $x$ contains a point in $A$
    and a point in $X \setminus A$ (in which case $x$ is in the boundary of $A$), or there exists an open ball centered 
    about $x$ which contains no points in $X \setminus A$ (in which case $x$ is in the interior of $A$). Thus, 
    $x \in A^\circ \cup bd(A)$. 
    \ \\\\
    Similarly, if $x \in A \setminus A^\circ$, then no open ball centered about $x$ is
    contained in $A$, and hence every open ball contains a point in $A$ ($x$ itself) and a point in $X \setminus A$ and
    so $x$ is therefore a boundary point of $A$. Hence any point in $A$ is either in the interior of $A$ or is a
    boundary point of $A$, and so $A \subseteq A^\circ \cup bd(A)$.
    \ \\\\
    Since $x \in A \cup A'$ was chosen to be arbitrary, we have that $A \cup A' \subseteq A^\circ \cup bd(A)$, and hence 
    $A \cup A' = A^\circ \cup bd(A)$, as desired.
\end{proof}

b. Prove that if either $A$ is open or it is closed, then $\text{bd}(A)^{\circ} = \emptyset$. Provide a counterexample
   which shows that this assertion fails when $A$ is neither open nor closed. \ \\
    
\begin{proof}\ \\\\
    Suppose that $bd(A)^{\circ}$ is non-empty. We will show that $A$ cannot be open or closed. Since $bd(A)^{\circ}$ is 
    non-empty, there exists some point $x \in bd(A)^{\circ}$, and because $bd(A)^{\circ} \subseteq bd(A)$, we have that
    $x$ is therefore also in the boundary of $A$. Moreover, because the interior of any set is open, there exists an 
    open ball $B_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq bd(A)$ centered about $x$; since $x \in bd(A)$, $B_{\epsilon}(x)$ also 
    contains a point $a \in A$ and a point $z \in X \setminus A$. If $A$ is open, then there exists an open ball 
    $B_{\delta}(a)$ centered about $a$ which is entirely contained in $A$. However, because $a$ is in the boundary of 
    $A$, every open ball about $a$ must necessarily contain a point in $A$ and a point in $X \setminus A$ , which 
    yields a contradiction. Similarly, if $A$ is closed, then $X \setminus A$ is open, and so there exists an open ball
    $B_{\delta}(z)$ centered about $z$ which is entirely contained in $X \setminus A$, which again contradicts the fact 
    that $z$ is in the boundary of $A$, as before. \\

    By contraposition, we see that if either $A$ is open or it is closed, then $\text{bd}(A)^{\circ} = \emptyset$. \\

    Lastly, observe that the set of rationals $\mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}$ is neither open nor closed, and that the
    closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is $\mathbb{R}$. Moreover, $\mathbb{R}$ is open and hence is equal to its interior. Since
    $\mathbb{R}$ is non-empty, we see that $bd(\mathbb{Q})^{\circ} = \mathbb{R} \neq \emptyset$.
    \ \\
