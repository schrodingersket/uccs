a.  Suppose that $\left\{f_n:[0,1] \to \mathbb{R}\right\}$ is a sequence of
    continuous functions which converges uniformly to $f$ on $[0, 1]$, and let
    $g_n = [f_n]^2$. Prove that $\{g_n\}$ converges uniformly to 
    $g = f^2$ on $[0, 1]$.\ \\

b.  Let $f:(0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be a uniformly continuous function. Prove that
    $f$ is bounded on $(0, 1]$. (Hint: First show that there exists a
    $\delta > 0$ such that $f:(0, \delta)\to\mathbb{R}$ is bounded). \ \\
