Let $K$ be a non-empty sequentially compact subspace of a metric space $(X, d)$.

a) Let $p_0$ be a point in $K$. Prove that there exists a number $M > 0$ such that $K$ is contained in the open ball
   $\mathcal{B}_M(p_0)$ of radius $M$ about the point $p_0$.

b) Let $\mathcal{O}$ be an open set in $X$ such that $K \subseteq \mathcal{O}$. Prove that there exists an $r > 0$ such
   that for every point $p \in K$, the open ball $\mathcal{B}_r(p)$ is contained in $\mathcal{O}$.
