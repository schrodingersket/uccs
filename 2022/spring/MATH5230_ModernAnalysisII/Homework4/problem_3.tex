a) Let $(X, d)$ be a metric space. Prove that $X$ is sequentially compact if and only if both of the following 
   conditions hold:

   i) $X$ is a complete metric space. \\
   ii) Every sequence $\{ x_n \} \subseteq X$ has a Cauchy subsequence.

b) Let $(X, d)$ be a sequentially compact metric space, and suppose that $f:X \to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function
   such that for each $x \in X$ there exists $x' \in X$ such that $|f(x')| \le \frac{1}{2}|f(x)|$.  Prove that there 
   exists a point $x_0 \in X$ such that $f(x_0) = 0$.
